    In January, I attended the Biodevices conference in Funchal, Madeira, where I presented a poster entitled *Thermoresponsive polymer-based microdevice for nano-liquid chromatography*.

"`Biodevices <http://www.biodevices.org/Biodevices2008/index.htm>`__\ " is short for "International conference on biomedical electronics and devices". It's a relatively young conference, but wide-encompassing, which made it quite interesting.

For this poster, I reused the `design I made with Scribus for MicroTAS 2007 <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2007/10/14/microtas-2007-paris-france/>`__ and I came up with a nice poster that I am now sharing here. Some PDF viewers may have some trouble displaying this file, because it uses transparency and layers. I recommend using the latest version of `Adobe Reader <http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/>`__.
