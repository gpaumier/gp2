    Around 130 Wikimedians attended the Wikimedia Conference 2009 in Berlin last month; they were Wikimedia chapter representatives, Wikimedia Foundation board members and staff, and software developers. This postmortem summarizes what happened, what went well and what could be improved in the next edition.


The Wikimedia Conference 2009 was held in Berlin, Germany, on April 3−5.
It was composed of three tracks:

-  a track for
   `chapters <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_chapters>`__,
   hosted by the `Deutsche Telekom
   Laboratories <http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/de:Deutsche_Telekom_Laboratories>`__
   (T-labs)
-  a track for the `board of
   trustees <http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Board_of_Trustees>`__
   of the `Wikimedia
   Foundation <http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home>`__, hosted by
   the T-labs
-  a track for `MediaWiki
   developers <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Developer_meet-up_2009>`__,
   hosted at the `c-base <http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:c-base>`__.

About 55 participants attended the chapters tracks, 10 people the board
track and 60 people the developers track. Social activities where
participants from all tracks could meet were proposed.

The preparation
was done on Meta-Wiki (`April 2009 Wikimedia
Conference <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/April_2009_Wikimedia_Conference>`__,
`Chapters meeting
2009 <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Chapters_meeting_2009>`__) and on
mediawiki.org (`Project:Developer meet-up
2009 <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Developer_meet-up_2009>`__).
A `group <http://identi.ca/group/wmcon>`__ was created on identica for
quick information.

The preparation and organization started two and a
half months before the conference (mid January). The deadlines were
roughly met by the organization team. All tasks requiring action from
the participants were delayed of at least a week, sometimes much longer.

Participants
============

Representatives from all existing Wikimedia chapters officially approved
by the WMF Board attended the meeting: Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Czech Republic, Switzerland, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Israel, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, New York City, Norway, Austria,
Poland, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, Serbia and Russia. Several participants
expressed their satisfaction about the fact that all chapters were
present at the meeting. This was partly made possible by the financial
help provided by sister chapters (see *Finances* below).

Five
participants (from Russia, Taiwan, Indonesia and Serbia) needed to get a
visa in order to enter Germany. Wikimedia Deutschland provided them with
invitation letters to facilitate the process, but the time needed to get
these letters was longer than expected. At least one participant had to
change his travel arrangements due to this delay, and as a consequence
he had to leave the conference early.

A few chapters needed convincing
to attend the meeting.

Finance
=======

Besides Wikimedia Deutschland, 5 other chapters provided financial
assistance to their fellow chapters in order to help them attend the
conference:

-  Wikimedia France: €4,000
-  Wikimedia CH: €2,000
-  Wikimedia Sverige: €1,463
-  Wikimedia Polska: €500
-  Wikimedia Italia: €400

Travel & transportation
=======================

Most of the participants needing subsidizing for their travel expenses
made special efforts to find low-cost flights. Each participant was
given three one-day tickets to use public transportation in Berlin. They
were also provided with a map and detailed indications on how to reach
all the conference locations. Some participants complained that some
itineraries were not ideal.

Venue & accommodation
=====================

We had some major issues with the venue. Our contact person at the
T-Labs wasn't very accommodating and the conference suffered from the
setup of the rooms (although the organization team did their best to
arrange things to minimize the participants' inconvenience). However,
the venue itself was great and the view was outstanding. Some
participants complained that the food wasn't sophisticated enough
(especially sandwiches on 2/3 lunches). They seemed satisfied with
dinners & the party. Some of them also complained about the
accommodation, but mainly about details (e.g. number of keys).

Program
=======

All the chapters board members & foundation staff members were requested
(several times) to provide input about what they wanted to actually
discuss and work upon during the conference (`Chapters meeting
2009/Brainstorming <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Chapters_meeting_2009/Brainstorming>`__).
This brainstorming was done in a wiki-way; it was supposed to last two
weeks, but was extended to three weeks because of the lack of input from
the chapters. The involvement of chapters in this brainstorming was
uneven; some chapters did not even participate in it, even after several
reminders.

When the brainstorming was over, the output was broken down
into specific key topics (`Chapters meeting
2009/Topics <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Chapters_meeting_2009/Topics>`__).
Identifying these topics was the first step needed to make a draft
schedule (`draft version of the
schedule <http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chapters_meeting_2009/Schedule&oldid=1419329>`__).
Some feedback and complaints were taken in account and `a revised
schedule was
proposed <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2009/04/02/full-svg-schedule-of-the-wikimedia-conference-2009-in-berlin/>`__
a few days later.

lthough all the topics raised during the
brainstorming were added to the schedule, some chapters still complained
that their wishes weren't taken into consideration enough. This may be
explained by the very different expectations the chapters had. It was
suggested to "group" similar chapters for future meetings using thematic
self-discrimination.

Schedule
========

Some participants complained about the "State of the chapters" session
and requested more time to present what their chapter was doing.
However, lightning talks were precisely the point of this session: the
goal was to present an overview and topics to be discussed during the
rest of the conference. Besides, with more than 20 chapters already, it
isn't possible to devote 15 minutes to each chapter (or *The conference
should last a week*, see below).

Many participants felt that there
weren't enough time for informal meetings; most of them expected a
Wikimania-like event (with a lot of socializing), whereas the conference
was designed as a professional meeting.

Preparation
===========

Many participants felt that the "State of the chapters" session was too
short; however, at the same time, their involvement in preparing it was
very low. This session was the only one for which a preparation was
requested to the participants (`Chapters meeting
2009/Preparation <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Chapters_meeting_2009/Preparation>`__),
and many of them didn't do it on time. That prevented the other
participants from having a better look at them, and also prevented the
organization team from preparing posters to be displayed in the
conference hall with this information (as a support for informal
discussion). Some participants prepared their presentation the night
before the conference, or even the morning during the others'
presentation.

Volunteers & documentation
==========================

A call for volunteers was made on de.wikipedia.org. There wasn't enough
volunteers to take notes for written documentation during the sessions.
However, all the sessions used Metaplan boards for moderation /
facilitation, and we had a few volunteers who took pictures of the
boards. This way we managed to document the essence of all discussions.
The photographers also captured some very interesting feelings and
moments of the conference.

Facilitation & moderation
=========================

The facilitation was one of the topics that received the most criticism
from the participants in the satisfaction survey. However, the
participants' comments were very inconsistent: some complained that the
moderation was too strong and that they were hindered by the
facilitator; they wished the discussions were less formal and done more
freely. On the other hand, some participants felt that the moderation
should have been stronger. At the same time, some shy participants
confided that they liked the method used by the facilitators because it
allowed them to really participate in the discussion. A possible
explanation to this variety of comments is that Wikimedians and chapters
representatives aren't used to professional methods of management and
moderation, and it will take some time for them to get used to it.

Another complaint was that the facilitators didn't understand the
community enough, and that they didn't have the "wiki" background. It is
true that the facilitators didn't come from the Wikimedia community.
However, they had some basic understanding of how Wikipedia worked, and
they were briefed during hours by the organization team to make them
understand how the Wikimedia universe works, what the relationships
between the different entities are (chapters, foundation, community).
Their performance was quite good overall given the complexity of the
topics involved. A participant also conjectured that it was very
difficult to moderate this conference because the participants formed "a
group of very individualistic, fiercely independent people."

Committees
==========

The committees were introduced in Berlin as an opportunity to hold
discussions in small persistent groups on specific topics. There was
little preparation from the participants before the conference
(`Chapters meeting
2009/Committees <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Chapters_meeting_2009/Committees>`__).
They met several times during the meeting and mailing lists were created
for each of them, in order to foster collaboration. Wikimedia CH agreed
to host these lists.

Satisfaction survey
===================

A short `satisfaction
survey <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2009/04/08/satisfaction-survey-for-the-wikimedia-conference-2009-in-berlin/>`__
was handed out to all the participants on Sunday morning. The details
are publicly available one meta-wiki. The comments were used to build
this postmortem.

General tips for future organizers
==================================

-  Organize & plan early; almost all chapters work with volunteers and
   it is *very* difficult to get things done.
-  Send individual e-mails & reminders. It takes a lot of time, but it
   saves even more time: people feel much more compelled to answer
   individual e-mails than e-mails sent to mailing lists.
-  Be prepared to hear complaints: there are so many chapters with
   various needs, expectations, various levels of development, etc. that
   it is impossible to satisfy everybody's wishes.
-  Having high expectations is a good thing, because it urges you to
   organize a good and successful event. However, be prepared to feel
   frustrated and disappointed when the outcome isn't what you expected
   because the participants didn't play their part.

The conference should last a week
=================================

Even if you tried to satisfy everybody's wishes, you would need at least
a whole week for the conference. Many Wikimedians (including chapters
representatives) lack a professional background and can't work with
deadlines & management methods. They want more time for presentations,
more time for workgroups, more time for informal discussions, more time
for social events, and more time for whatever is on the schedule. That
just *can't* work.
