.. highlights::

    From 2011 to 2014, I managed technical communications at the Wikimedia Foundation. This notably included: assembling, editing and publishing monthly technical reports; authoring and editing technical blog posts; and creating and maintaining tools and processes for project documentation.

Part of my job focused on processes: I designed, implemented and optimized information architecture, systems and tools to facilitate the flow of information among communication actors, in radically collaborative environments, through the lens of user experience and defensive design.

• I designed a system of templates & tools to generate monthly reports from project-specific status updates, removing hurdles and potential sources of disruption and error.

• I created a system of project pages run with templates & transclusion of content, avoiding duplication while allowing for faceted displays.

• I documented those processes thoroughly, notably with context-aware tips and more general how-to guides. This ensures reproducibility, consistency and continuity throughout the editorial process (generation, proofreading and dissemination).


My other main focus was on content: I scheduled communications, created original content and edited publications by technical staff.

• I designed and executed communication plans for high-profile technical announcements, such as new features and disruptive site maintenance. I summarized long technical documents and translated them from tech jargon to plain English in order to reach a wider audience.

• I supported engineering staff in communicating on their accomplishments through various channels, notably the Wikimedia Blog. I scheduled and reviewed articles on a wide variety of topics, from general updates to unapologetically technical, in-depth, industry-focused posts.

• I coordinated the writing of a chapter on the architecture of MediaWiki, for inclusion in the ‘Architecture of Open Source Applications' book. Pulling information from multiple sources, I hierarchized and organized content into a logical, up-to-date and comprehensive description of Wikipedia's software.
