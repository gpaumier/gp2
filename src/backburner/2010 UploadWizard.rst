.. highlights::

    As part of the Multimedia Usability Project, I researched, designed and tested a new interface for uploading files to Wikimedia Commons, the free media library associated with Wikipedia. In collaboration with illustrator Michael Bartalos, I also led a project to design a licensing tutorial with the Wikimedia Commons community, and integrate it into the new UploadWizard on Wikimedia Commons.

The Multimedia Usability Project aimed to improve the interfaces and workflows for multimedia uploading on Wikimedia websites. Its main result was the development of a step-by-step, context-aware, customizable file uploader called UploadWizard. As of August 2013, about 3 million files have been uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons media library using UploadWizard.


My main focus during this project was on user research, product management and design.

• I designed, implemented and analyzed a multilingual online user survey that collected 25,000+ complete responses from current contributors to Wikimedia Commons. I also conducted user interviews, and an analysis of open bugs & feature requests.

• I synthesized all the results into prioritized product requirements, and created design documents for the user interface and contribution workflows.

• I also managed the production of an illustrated licensing tutorial, including product requirements, close work with the illustrator, translations, and integration with UploadWizard.

• I organized and oversaw a formal usability study conducted by a user experience firm to evaluate the new interface, assess the progress made and indicate areas of improvement.


I also handled project-related communications and management.

• I managed the development roadmap in coordination with the software developer and program manager.

• I coordinated collaboration opportunities with Wikimedia volunteers and third parties, and ensured an open development process.

• I managed most communications related to the project, such as public updates on blogs and wiki pages, conferences, and project reports.
