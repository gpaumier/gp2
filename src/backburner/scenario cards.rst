   Organized disinformation

* Bad actors pummel the public with multi-channel disinformation campaigns to destabilize governments and undermine democracy.
* States target their own citizens with propaganda for control and ideological motives.
* Elaborate fakes are made possible by new technologies and artificial intelligence, sowing doubt on the authenticity of everything.

   :alt: Gears of Marinoni's printing machine
   :figwidth: 30em

   Technological arms race

Big Tech companies have invested heavily in technologies to combat bad actors:

* tools to circumvent censorship
* ways to identify and derank information that is not from established reputable sources
* shared reputation scores for internet users based on all the data they collect to determine who is trustworthy online.

New barriers to participation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Barbed_tape_on_the_Golden_Gate_bridge_in_San_Francisco_139.jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   New barriers to participation

* Faced with a deluge of disinformation and editors acting in bad faith, most Wikipedia communities have erected social and technical dams.
* Entire countries are blocked from editing due to sustained cyberattacks.
* All the product improvements developed in the past twenty years to make it easier for newcomers to contribute have been counter-balanced by more stringent policies and heavy moderation tools developed in the last ten.

   Humans and machines fight bad actors together

* In trolls, censors, and purveyors of lies, Wikipedians have found a common enemy to unite them.
* Tech giants have become unexpected allies of Wikipedians in the greater fight against propaganda and sabotage.

Knowledge inequity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Native_American_In_Ink_(2321809).jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   Knowledge inequity

* The knowledge and communities systematically left out are excluded more than ever.
* Historical structures of power and privilege have been reinforced by algorithms and defensiveness.
* More people care about guarding the temple of knowledge than about asking whose knowledge it is.
* In a world of fake newspapers and fabricated audiobooks, oral citations are a non-starter.

The personal cost of the War On Lies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Edvard_Munch_-_The_Scream_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   The personal cost of the War On Lies

* The fight has taken an undeniable toll on the health of communities.
* Originally energized by the righteousness of their mission to defend Wikipedia against the hordes, more and more Wikipedians are retiring from the wikis due to burnout, doxxing, or simply lack of enjoyment in contributing.

   Tech giants to the (financial) rescue

* Although readership has declined dramatically, tech giants have stepped in to partly make up for the decrease in donations from readers.
* Big Tech companies know they can't win the arms race against disinformation without Wikipedia's armies of humans.

   :figwidth: 30em

   Increase in technology prices

* Geopolitical, economic, and environmental instability in Asia creates an extended shortage of computer chips.
* New environmental laws heavily tax electronic products to reflect their impact on the planet.
* The resulting, prolonged increase in the price of all technological hardware weakens tech giants worldwide.

Wikipedia is everywhere online
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Editing_FilePuzzle1_found_bw.jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   Wikipedia is everywhere online

* Wikimedia's opulence enabled its content to become more accessible and embeddable into all the major devices and experiences that have emerged in the past ten years.
* Knowledge is more structured, bite-sized, and media-driven.
* The concept of the encyclopedia has now disappeared.

Wikipedia's disappearing act
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Große_Linde_bei_Teuchatz_P1320563-PS.jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   Wikipedia's disappearing act

* As the margins of big tech corporations waned, so did their scruples and seemingly benevolent intentions. Their smaller size made them both more desperate and less subject to scrutiny
* Tech corporations are aggressively exploiting the digital commons without any desire to invest in its long-term sustainability.

   The mammut with feet of clay

* Wikipedia is everywhere, but has become invisible to users, like electricity.
* Knowledge is mainly accessed through third parties: hardly anyone visits Wikipedia sites directly any more.
* With so few humans on the sites, and no way to contribute content from third parties, content growth has fallen to pre-2003 levels.

------------------------

Google acquires Wikipedia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Concentration_(26854203121).jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   Google acquires Wikipedia

* At the request of the Foundation, Wikipedia was just acquired by Google after years of struggling financially.
* Deprived of readers, and therefore of donors and contributors, the options for survival were few.
* Google has promised editorial independence, but the few remaining editors expect the giant to kill off the site in the next few years.

   Tensions in the Arctic

* The melting of the ice caps due to global warming caused a struggle for control between Arctic powers.
* Defense spending is eating more and more of national budgets.
* Governments have increasingly relied on large tech corporations to take on social services and infrastructure projects.

Machines become smarter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/Artificial-intelligence-155161_1280.png
   :figwidth: 30em

   Machines become smarter

* Third-party corporations don't even need new content from Wikipedia any more.
* Machines can automatically assemble information that is more relevant, more local, and more timely than what humans can produce.
* Knowledge is served by algorithms to customers in their preferred tongue, through their interface of the moment, at the level of detail they need.

The Great Equalizer of Knowledge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/The_scales_of_justice_(4984060658).jpg
   :figwidth: 30em

   The Great Equalizer of Knowledge

* Thanks to the machines' ability to ingest and understand content in any language, knowledge and news from historically disenfranchised populations have entered the global knowledge corpus.
* Knowledge is available to all, regardless of culture, region, or language.

   :figwidth: 30em

   Biased algorithms

* Knowledge is available to all, but whose knowledge is it?
* Long-standing structures of power and privilege can still be discerned: the machines and algorithms are still children of profit, and their rich, powerful creators have little incentive to make them auditable and accountable.

   Solar storms destroy communication infrastructure

* Geomagnetic solar storms cause electromagnetic surges across the northern hemisphere that permanently bring down most of the Internet infrastructure.
* Wikimedia server farms are mostly intact thanks to their hardened environment.
* Local makeshift communication systems are set up within a few months in cities but remain isolated.

   Irreparable reputation damage

* Bad actors infiltrate Wikipedia communities and slyly implement a years-long campaign to destroy its credibility.
* The campaign culminates into a series of high-profile scandals across continents.
* The Wikipedia brand becomes synonymous with disinformation and nonsense.

   End of Safe Harbor provision

* U.S. lawmakers cave to copyright lobbies and end the Safe Harbor provision for online storage (DMCA 512).
* To prevent copyright violations, online service providers based in the U.S., like Wikipedia, are now legally required to filter all text and multimedia content before it can be published online.
