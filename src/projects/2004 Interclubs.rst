.. highlights::

    In 2005 and 2006, I co-organized the Interclubs shows, an annual series of scripted performances bringing together hundreds of students from dozens of clubs, from the astronomy club, to the Salsa dance club, to the karate club, to the library club. This included writing the play’s script, creating the décor and costumes, coordinating the appearances of all the clubs, and surviving a ridiculous number of puns.
