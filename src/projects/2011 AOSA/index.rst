In 2011, I authored a chapter about the architecture of MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia and its sister sites, for inclusion in the book *The Architecture of Open Source Applications, volume 2*. The chapter was based on the shared knowledge of MediaWiki developers, and written in collaboration with Sumana Harihareswara.
