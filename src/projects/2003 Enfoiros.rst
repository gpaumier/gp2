    For two years, I was a member of a student club supporting a charity that provides food to the needy, notably by raising funds through a series of concerts.


The *`Enfoiros <http://etud.insa-toulouse.fr/~enfoiros/>`__* is a
student club from the *Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de
Toulouse*, the "*Grande École*\ " (a.k.a. engineering college) I
attended. Founded in 2000, the club's purpose revolves around activities
aimed at supporting the *Restaurants du Cœur* ("*les Restos*\ "), a
French charity providing food and support to the needy. The club was
inspired by the
*`Enfoirés <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Enfoir%C3%A9s>`__*, a
group of mainstream artists and celebrities who perform in a yearly
series of concerts. All proceeds from the concert (and associated
products, such as CDs and DVDs) benefit the *Restos*. The student club
built on this idea, and each year the group of students, faculty and
college staff performs in a similar series of concerts. The opening
night of the series of concerts is reserved for the people in need who
benefit from the Restos' help: they get to be the first to enjoy the
yearly performance. The club also organizes food collection campaigns
among students, entertainment for the needy, and other activities to
benefit the Restos, like volunteering at gift-wrapping booths during the
holiday season. I joined the club in 2003 and participated in its
activities until I graduated in 2005. I have the fondest memories from
these two years, taking action to help the needy, being on stage and
performing and, most of all, being part of a community of friends and
like-minded people who were, for a time, a real family. Volunteering and
performing for the *Enfoiros* always has a bittersweet taste: of course,
it was fun to rehearse and perform the concerts, and to take part into
other group activities; but we'd all rather it not be necessary at all.
But heh, as long as there are people in need, we figured we might as
well have fun supporting them and connecting with them.
