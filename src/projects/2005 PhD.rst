.. highlights::

    For three years, I worked at the crossroads of physics, microelectronics, biology and chemistry to develop miniaturized laboratories based on a polymer that changes properties with temperature.


• Worked on miniaturized systems for chemical and biological analysis ("labs on chips")
• Developed a new technology based on thermosensitive polymer coatings
• Explored applications in controlled electro-osmosis and controlled adsorption/release of proteins

Labs on chips are miniaturized devices integrating one or several laboratory functions, usually dedicated to the handling of chemical and biological samples. My work aimed at integrating a smart polymer called poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in microsystems, in order to develop a new technological process for labs on chips. PNIPAM is a thermosensitive polymer that undergoes a reversible state transition; it switches from a hydrophilic, swollen state below its temperature of transition (LCST ~ 32°C), to a hydrophobic, collapsed state above it. The technology I developed was based on heating elements and a surface functionalization process to graft the PNIPAM layer. My results showed that the electro-osmotic flow could be modulated by thermally controlling the PNIPAM, thus paving the way for electrokinetic mixers. This thermal control also enabled the adsorption (and partial desorption) of proteins on fonctionalized beads, the main application being sample preparation.

I published earlier some infographics I created for `my Ph.D thesis <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/12/19/ph-d-thesis-available-for-download-and-reuse/>`__, for example the `comparison between biological and technological objects <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/07/07/interdisciplinarity-biology-micro-nanotechnologies/>`__ at the micro and nano scale. Below are a few more specific to PNIPAM; they're now also available to illustrate Wikipedia articles about PNIPAM.

Conformational switch
---------------------

.. figure:: /images/2008-11-06_PNIPAM_switch.svg

PNIPAM is a thermosensitive polymer that undergoes a reversible coil-to-globule conformational transition around its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), around 32°C. It switches from a hydrophilic, swollen state to a hydrophobic, collapsed state.

PNIPAM-based immunoassay
------------------------

The peculiar properties of PNIPAM make it possible to use this polymer as a support for immunoassays based on thermal precipitation.

Cell culture
------------

PNIPAM-grafted surfaces can be used as a soft support for cell cultures. Cells grow on hydrophobic PNIPAM and are softly released by lowering the temperature and making the PNIPAM hydrophilic.

Adsorption and release of proteins
----------------------------------

The same way cells adsorb on hydrophobic PNIPAM surfaces, proteins may be reversibly trapped on PNIPAM surfaces, then released upon command. This is actually one of the things I did during my Ph.D.
