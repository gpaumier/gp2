.. highlights::

    In 2016–2017, I was a Lead Architect for Wikimedia 2030, a global, participatory strategy process involving dozens of movement organizations and thousands of individuals. I was key in designing the process and guiding the movement through an intense exercise involving several cycles of community discussions, in-person events, interviews with experts, and commissioned research.

    I led the synthesis of all inputs, conversations, and research into several drafts that were further discussed and edited. I was the main author of the Strategic Direction that emerged and went on to be endorsed by hundred Wikimedia organizations around the world.

    The Strategic Direction of "Knowledge Equity and Knowledge as a Service" now serves as the compass for multi-year strategic planning by Wikimedia organizations, and guides decision-making around roles, responsibilities, and resources in the Wikimedia movement.

Building a strategy is hard. Imagine building a shared strategy across a movement of hundreds of thousands of stakeholders, with no direct line of communication with most of them, no predetermined outcome, and while rebuilding trust and good faith that have been eroded in the past. Imagine building a collaborative strategy from the ground up, in true Wikipedian fashion, through a dialogue happening around the world in dozens of languages.

That's what we did.

We didn't know how we were going to do it. We didn't know how it was going to go. We didn't know what the result was going to be. We did it anyway, because it was the only way to build trust and alignment across the movement.

Building a strategy is hard, but we are a movement of smart, passionate people obsessed with facts, citations, and intellectual integrity. We have in common a passion for free knowledge and a commitment to serving all human beings. If anyone could build a collaborative strategy, we could.

And so it began.

We put together a team. We designed a process, and adjusted it many times. Our aim was to identify a common strategic direction that would unite and inspire people across our movement on our way to 2030, and help us make decisions. I was part of the `small core team <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/People/Core_team>`__ leading this process, along with other employees of the Wikimedia Foundation and in the movement, and the folks at `Williamsworks <http://williamsworks.com/>`__.

We started from a simple question: *What do we want to build or achieve together by 2030?* The strategic direction was not meant to be a strategic plan. Plans are usually for 3–5 years, executable and measurable, specific to organizational capacity and resources. The direction needed to be broad, enduring, ambitious, and clear enough to provide guidance on overarching goals against which a specific plan could be built. Using 2030 as a time horizon enabled us to untangle our aspirations from our more immediate roles and interests, and let our imagination roam more freely.

From on-wiki discussions, to large conferences, to small meetups, to expert interviews, to desk and field research, the process was exhaustive, messy, and fascinating. It did not take long to confirm that the greatest strength of the Wikimedia movement is the talent, dedication, and integrity of its members. We are all part of this movement because we share a belief that :doc:`free knowledge makes the world a better place <stakes-of-knowledge>`.

Thinking about the future is an exercise in imagination, but we're Wikimedians, so it was an exercise in imagination based on facts, trends, and sources. We looked around to figure out what we already knew about the world we would be living in in 2030. We knew that there would be a lot more people in it, particularly in Asia and Africa.\ [#UNpop]_ We knew that technology would evolve dramatically, notably through `mobile devices <https://www.slideshare.net/a16z/mobile-is-eating-the-world-2016/10-10Everyone_gets_a_pocket_supercomputerMobile>`__, `rich media <http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends>`__, messaging, and `new interfaces <http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x>`__. We knew that it would be taking `about a hundred years <https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-wait-100-years-bridging-the-gap-in-global-education/>`__ for children in low-income countries to catch up to the education levels achieved in developed countries. And we knew that there was a trend towards a `centralization of the internet <https://www.fastcompany.com/3068627/internet-aws-cloud-centralization>`__  and a consolidation of power in the hands of a `few giant companies <http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707048-small-group-giant-companiessome-old-some-neware-once-again-dominating-global>`__, notably `in the tech industry <http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/09/how-a-few-monster-tech-firms-are-taking-over-everything-from-media-to-space-travel-and-what-it-means-for-the-rest-of-us.html>`__ .

Fast forward a little under a year, and dozens of groups and organizations endorsed the new strategic direction, focused on `"Knowledge as a service" and "Knowledge equity <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction>`__."

Several themes emerged from the mass of information and were further integrated into successive drafts of the direction. `A stable version emerged <https://blog.wikimedia.org/2017/08/10/wikimedia-2030-draft-strategic-direction/>`__ shortly before the Wikimania conference in August, and was discussed extensively online and in Montréal. I rewrote it, revised it, refined it, and it eventually became the final version of the strategic direction.

After years of tensions between the Wikimedia Foundation and other actors of the Wikimedia movement, groups and individuals started declaring their intent to work together towards this future by `endorsing the direction <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction/Endorsement>`__. In less than a week, over 70 groups and organizations had already endorsed it; they had committed to participating in the next phase in good faith and to come to an agreement on roles, responsibilities, and organizational strategies that would enable the movement to implement that future. In the end nearly 100 groups and organizations signed on, representing an unprecedented alignment in the history of the Wikimedia movement.

Cyndi Suarez from *Nonprofit Quarterly* wrote that "`Wikimedia's Strategic Direction Project is a Model of Democracy <https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2018/03/30/wikimedias-strategic-direction-project-model-democracy/>`__." Over at *Forbes*, Michael Bernick, describing "`The Power Of The Wikimedia Movement Beyond Wikimedia <https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2018/03/28/the-power-of-the-wikimedia-movement-beyond-wikimedia/#42557f8e5a75>`__," concluded that "[Wikimedia] gives us glimpses of what is possible in questioning hierarchies and gatekeepers—the creativity and energy unleashed, the involvement, the common ground possible—even as it continues to question and seek to improve its own structure." Ryan Merkley is fond of saying that "`Nobody does strategy like this <https://twitter.com/ryanmerkley/status/1260214328235622401>`__."

And yet, it worked.

Wikimedia 2030 was arguably the largest participatory process the Wikimedia movement had ever undertaken. For several months, the movement buzzed with activity, as people went through cycles of discussion online and in-person, and converged towards the direction.

To ensure a rich discussion and a legitimate outcome, we intentionally reached out to "new voices." They were not just people outside the movement, but also people *within* the movement who didn't traditionally participate in this kind of discussions. We contracted eighteen coordinators to organize and facilitate discussions in many languages, with support from the Foundation's Community Engagement team. Volunteers and groups also organized discussions with their communities and affiliates across wikis and off-wiki. This encouraged many contributors to participate in the discussion by avoiding the “`Not my wiki <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Not_my_wiki>`__” syndrome, which causes Wikipedians to avoid discussions that happen outside of their immediate online surroundings.

All those discussions and research projects produced massive amounts of notes, reports, and documentation, `meticulously collected <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Reports>`__ so that anyone could follow facts and decisions to their source, and to make it easier for people joining the process later to catch up.

Wikimania 2017: first opportunity to discuss the draft strategic direction. Largest event in the Wikimedia movement

Language, metaphors. Some inspiration from Nadia Eghbal's research report for the Ford Foundation: `Roads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure <https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/>`__

Simple language, more universal words to avoid jargon, and easier to translate

feedback from the Movement

instead, more precise (and complex words), and translate concepts instead of words

duality of the movement; socio-technical systems

A global effort / Bringing in new voices
========================================

As we're looking at the trends to consider, we also need to go beyond what we know and who we know. Our vision, what we're set to accomplish, requires that we realize that we're not alone. We're part of an ecosystem, and we need others. We need partners. Those voices will help define our future, because they're part of it.

This work involves hundreds of interviews, small-group discussions (“salons”), research, and building relationships for future collaboration. The Foundation is notably partnering with Reboot in Indonesia and Brazil to conduct research that is complementary to what was done with the New Readers program in countries where Wikimedia isn't as well known as what we're used to. They will interview partners, subject matter experts, and conduct contextual inquiries with readers in their own environment using methods of design research. In parallel, online surveys are being conducted in the places where we are the most popular, to understand how people perceive and use Wikimedia.

This work will inform and complement community discussions with new voices that haven't traditionally been included in strategy discussions, or that are not yet part of the movement. They can help us identify the global trends that I mentioned earlier as what we should be considering as we discuss our future. For example, scenario planning is going to help us better understand what the world will look like in 2030, notably in terms of demographics, technology, media consumption habits, access to knowledge, and policy.

Some of that has already happened, and it will continue over the next few months. The information will be posted on Meta as it comes in. If you have recommendations of experts and partners in your circles or geographies that would enrich this discussion, you're welcome to suggest their names on Meta. But more importantly, you can reach out to them yourself. The Foundation can't do this alone; we are a global and distributed movement, and local relationships are much more likely to bear fruit than a centralized approach. The Foundation has also reserved budget for affiliates who want to run small-group discussions with subject matter experts. If this is something that motivates you, you can contact me and I will direct you to the people who can provide some advice on how to proceed.

What comes next
===============

"Phase 2"

Movement discussions

Wikimedia Foundation internal planning

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_2030/Process_planning


Some of the upcoming discussions will revolve around “big questions” like movement roles, governance, and decision making, while others will be more goal-oriented and will aim to build organizational strategies and multi-year strategic plans.

For my part: decided to focus on another endeavor as I joined the Wikimedia Foundation's :doc:`Advancement department <wikimedia-advancement>`. I continued to participate in Wikimedia 2030 as a member of the "Revenue Streams" working group, whose mission was to .... I also continued to advise the Wikimedia 2030 core team as needed.

I was not done thinking about the future though. Taking the long view. :doc:`2031 scenarios <2031-scenarios>`
