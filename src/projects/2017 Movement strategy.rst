.. highlights::

    In 2016–2017, I was one of the Lead Architects of Wikimedia 2030, an ambitious collaborative strategy process involving dozens of movement organizations and hundreds of individuals. I was key in designing the process and guiding the movement through an intense exercise involving several cycles of community discussions, in-person events, interviews with experts, and commissioned research.

    I led the synthesis of the inputs, conversations, and research into several drafts that were further discussed and edited. I was the main author of the Strategic Direction that emerged and went on to be endorsed by nearly a hundred Wikimedia organizations around the world.

    The Strategic Direction of "Knowledge Equity and Knowledge as a Service" now serves as the compass for multi-year strategic planning by Wikimedia organizations, and guides decision-making around roles, responsibilities, and resources in the Wikimedia movement.

Goal
====



Where is the Wikimedia movement going? What do we want to achieve together? What impact could we have in the world? To answer those questions, the Wikimedia movement launched Wikimedia 2030: a global discussion to define Wikimedia’s future role in the world.


Introduction
============

In 2001, we started with a simple, ambitious idea: to build a truly free, global encyclopedia. None of us could have predicted how vast and useful it would become today. Wikipedia started as an experiment enabled by what the internet was becoming at the time. We didn’t set out to make the print encyclopedia obsolete—it was simply the natural progression of marrying knowledge sharing with this new network of inputs and outputs.

But the world is changing, rapidly. The old internet is no longer how most people share information, and we need to adapt to where knowledge sharing is going. Wikimedia will only thrive if it meets the real needs of its contributors and readers. The role of the drafting committee is simply to share its perspective on the opportunities it sees for Wikimedia to evolve in a changing world. How it can become more useful. More trustworthy. More engaging and dynamic. And more accessible by anyone, whoever they are, wherever they are, whatever they’re curious about.

Today, we envision a world in which every human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. This vision challenges us to consider what we must strengthen in the Wikimedia movement, and what we need to change. It urges us to engage with the world, to continue to add to our vast network of knowledge, and to empower people to participate in its creation, curation, and dissemination.


Background and process
======================

In January 2017, we, the constituents of Wikimedia, started an ambitious discussion about our collective future. We reflected on our past sixteen years together and imagined the impact we could have in the world in the next decades. Our aim was to identify a common strategic direction that would unite and inspire people across our movement on our way to 2030, and help us make decisions.

From on-wiki discussions, to large conferences, to small meetups, to expert interviews, to research, the process has been exhaustive, messy, and fascinating. It did not take long to confirm that the greatest strength of Wikimedia is the talent, dedication, and integrity of its members. Any successful strategy must accommodate the diversity of the people in our communities, including our particular interests, motivations, and contributions. Some of us write encyclopedia articles. Some of us develop software. Some of us donate money, time, or expertise. Some curate data, sources, or media. Some organize events, advocate for copyright reform, or remix artwork. Some are community organizers, educators, or copy editors. Some of us do all of the above, and more.

What brings us together is not what we do; it’s why we do it.

We are all part of this movement because we share a belief that free knowledge makes the world a better place. Every human being deserves easy access to knowledge. And every human being should have an opportunity to participate in compiling and sharing back their own knowledge.

Background and process (alternative/old)
========================================

In January 2017, we began to consider our collective future. Our global community was asked to imagine the impact we could have in the world in the next decades. Our aim has been to define a common strategic direction that would unite and inspire people across our movement on our way to 2030. We intend to use this direction as the basis to strengthen our work, challenge our assumptions, experiment with the future, build clear plans, and set priorities around resources and allocation. [1]_

.. [1] The strategic direction is not meant to be a strategic plan. Plans are 3-5 years, executable and measurable, specific to organizational capacity/resources, and should give us points to assess progress/viability. The direction should be broad, enduring, and ambitious, and clear enough to provide guidance on overarching goals against which a plan with those specifics can be built. The strategic direction is on a 12-year timeline because it allows people to focus on aspirational end goals rather than what it means for their immediate roles and interests. We will talk more about strategic plans in phase 2, starting in November 2017.

The process has been exhaustive, delightful, messy and fascinating. More than 80 Wikimedia groups and communities from across our movement have `held strategy discussions <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Sources>`__ in the past seven months. Strategy conversations at the `Wikimedia Conference in Berlin <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Conference_2017/Documentation/Movement_Strategy_track>`__ in March 2017 included 350 people from 70 countries, representatives of around 90 affiliates, organizations, committees and other groups. [2]_

.. [2] The Foundation conducted one-on-one interviews with 58 experts, including journalists, government officials, technology entrepreneurs, educators, nonprofit leaders, and many others. Moreover, with the help of affiliates, the Foundation has hosted curated discussions with 179 influential individuals and changemakers in Lagos (18), Nairobi (5), Brussels (25), San Francisco (12), Chennai (22), Berlin (15), Warsaw (14), Mexico City (12), Abidjan (27), Santiago (14), and New York (15). Guests ranged from a filmmaker just nominated as Nigeria's entry for an Academy Award to the Director of the National Security Project at the ACLU. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_2/Learn#Conversations_with_experts.2C_partners.2C_and_users

We also complemented our own discussions with perspectives from those outside of our existing communities. Conversations with more than 250 experts have taken place in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and Latin America. [3]_ Research on readers across the globe has provided a clearer look into new ways people are accessing information.[5] We reviewed secondary research on issues that will affect our mission on our way to 2030, such as the future of the global population, technology, misinformation, and more. [4]_ Together, these findings are helping us identify global trends and some key opportunities for our movement in this changing world.

.. [3] The Foundation contracted an online Awareness, Attitudes and Usage survey with 8,050 internet users aged 13-49 in seven countries where the Wikimedia projects are more widely known or used: France, Germany, Japan, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Sources/Brand_awareness,_attitudes,_and_usage_-_Executive_Summary; The Foundation has also contracted field research to better understand the needs of potential users in countries where Wikimedia project are less widely known or used, including interviews with 120 people in Indonesia and Brazil, which built on prior research with 138 people in Nigeria and India. https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Sources/Indonesia_research_findings_draft_May_2017 and https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_2/Reach/Generative_research_summary

.. [4] `Considering 2030: Misinformation, verification, and propaganda <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Sources/Considering_2030:_Misinformation,_verification,_and_propaganda_(July_2017)>`__; `Considering 2030: Future technology trends that will impact the Wikimedia movement <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Sources/Considering_2030:_Future_technology_trends_that_will_impact_the_Wikimedia_movement_(July_2017)>`__; `Considering 2030: Demographic Shifts – How might Wikimedia extend its reach by 2030? <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Sources/Considering_2030:_Demographic_Shifts_%E2%80%93_How_might_Wikimedia_extend_its_reach_by_2030%3F>`__

It didn’t take long for us to see that our greatest strength is our volunteer community. Any successful strategic direction must accommodate the diversity of the people in our communities, including their particular interests, motivations, and contributions. Some of us write encyclopedia articles. Some of us develop software. Some of us donate money, time, or expertise. Some curate data, sources, or media. Some organize events, advocate for copyright reform, or remix artwork. Some are community organizers, educators, or researchers. Some are just very curious people. And some are wikignomes. Some of us do all of the above, and more.

What brings us together is not what we do; it’s why we do it. And any successful strategic direction must celebrate this intention, and elevate it to draw even more people into our movement who care about the same thing.

We are all part of this movement because we share a belief that free knowledge makes the world a better place. Every human being deserves access to information, and has innate capacity to participate in its creation, curation, and sharing. That is non-negotiable. Sharing knowledge is how, in 2001, we started to make our mark in the world. We are a part of the biggest collaborative open information sharing experiment in human history. Let’s see how far we can take it.

Imagining the future
====================

As we reflect back on what we’ve accomplished, we can also ask ourselves: What more can we do? What else should we do in the next 16 years? And so we’ve started thinking about what we want to have done by 2030, because 2030 is a round number and we as humans tend to like round numbers. Thinking about our future is an exercise in imagination, but we’re Wikimedians, so it’s an exercise in imagination based on facts, trends, and sources.

What do we know about the world we’ll be living in in 2030? We know that there will be a lot more people in it, `particularly in Asia and Africa <http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html>`__. We know that technology will evolve dramatically, notably through `mobile devices <https://www.slideshare.net/a16z/mobile-is-eating-the-world-2016/10-10Everyone_gets_a_pocket_supercomputerMobile>`__, `rich media <http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends>`__, messaging, and `new interfaces <http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/03/elon-musk-billion-dollar-crusade-to-stop-ai-space-x>`__. We know that it’s currently going to take `about a hundred years <https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-wait-100-years-bridging-the-gap-in-global-education/>`__ for children in low-income countries to catch up to the education levels achieved in developed countries. And we know that there is a trend towards a `centralization of the internet <https://www.fastcompany.com/3068627/internet-aws-cloud-centralization>`__  and a consolidation of power in the hands of a `few giant companies <http://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21707048-small-group-giant-companiessome-old-some-neware-once-again-dominating-global>`__, notably `in the tech industry <http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/09/how-a-few-monster-tech-firms-are-taking-over-everything-from-media-to-space-travel-and-what-it-means-for-the-rest-of-us.html>`__ .

Bringing in new voices
======================

As we’re looking at the trends to consider, we also need to go beyond what we know and who we know. Our vision, what we’re set to accomplish, requires that we realize that we’re not alone. We’re part of an ecosystem, and we need others. We need partners. Those voices will help define our future, because they’re part of it.

This work involves hundreds of interviews, small-group discussions (“salons”), research, and building relationships for future collaboration. The Foundation is notably partnering with Reboot in Indonesia and Brazil to conduct research that is complementary to what was done with the New Readers program in countries where Wikimedia isn’t as well known as what we’re used to. They will interview partners, subject matter experts, and conduct contextual inquiries with readers in their own environment using methods of design research. In parallel, online surveys are being conducted in the places where we are the most popular, to understand how people perceive and use Wikimedia.

This work will inform and complement community discussions with new voices that haven’t traditionally been included in strategy discussions, or that are not yet part of the movement. They can help us identify the global trends that I mentioned earlier as what we should be considering as we discuss our future. For example, scenario planning is going to help us better understand what the world will look like in 2030, notably in terms of demographics, technology, media consumption habits, access to knowledge, and policy.

Some of that has already happened, and it will continue over the next few months. The information will be posted on Meta as it comes in. If you have recommendations of experts and partners in your circles or geographies that would enrich this discussion, you’re welcome to suggest their names on Meta. But more importantly, you can reach out to them yourself. The Foundation can’t do this alone; we are a global and distributed movement, and local relationships are much more likely to bear fruit than a centralized approach. The Foundation has also reserved budget for affiliates who want to run small-group discussions with subject matter experts. If this is something that motivates you, you can contact me and I will direct you to the people who can provide some advice on how to proceed.


Community discussions
=====================

This research and outreach will continue to inform the community discussions, which have been going on the past few months. From the first sessions at the Foundation’s all-hands meeting, to on-wiki discussions, to workshops organized by affiliates, to the recent Wikimedia Conference in Berlin, our movement has been buzzing with activity.

When I talk about bringing in new voices, it’s not just about people outside the movement. It’s also about people within the movement who don’t traditionally participate in this kind of discussion. This is why 18 coordinators were contracted to organize and facilitate discussions in many languages, with support from the Foundation’s Community Engagement team. Volunteers and groups have also organized discussions with their communities and affiliates across wikis and off-wiki. This has encouraged many contributors to participate in the discussion by avoiding the “`Not my wiki <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Not_my_wiki>`__” syndrome.

Some of the processes in the past few years have been more guided, for example by asking for people’s thoughts on the role of mobile devices, and some participants felt too constrained. This time, the discussion started at an earlier stage from a mostly blank page, with a bigger question. It was about imagining the role of the movement and what we would have achieved by 2030.

Many participants enjoyed the freedom that this big question allowed, and contributed insightful responses, resulting in over 1800 statements collected from the various communities. For others, the question was too vague, and they felt that they needed more specific questions to be able to contribute constructively. That’s completely fine, and if that was your case, you will have opportunities to discuss specific topics in more details starting next week.

A closer look at the themes (cycle 1)
=====================================

Now, I’ve mentioned that not everyone feels comfortable with big questions about imagining the future, and that’s completely fine. People think in different ways. Some need the freedom to explore their thoughts based on a short prompt; others need to focus on more specific topics and issues to really be able to think about what they mean.

And that’s what we’re all going to start doing in about a week. Right now, the team is starting to organize all the information that has emerged so far and preparing deep discussions about the main topics. Maybe you’re really interested in content gaps and biases; or moving beyond the model of the western encyclopedia; or possible business models across the movement; or fostering a sustainable and healthy community. You will have the opportunity to research and discuss these topics in detail.

If you haven’t participated until now, or if you’ve felt that you didn’t have anything to contribute, I encourage you to look out for the topic discussions that will start in a week. Together, we will begin to make sense of all this information and organize it into something that describes the direction we are imagining for our movement.

Cycle 2 themes
==============

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Cycle_2

Over the past few weeks, the movement strategy team grouped the comments into five initial themes that emerged consistently across the conversations. Each of them now has a page on Meta-Wiki[1] with more details and information about how to participate in the relevant discussion:

* Healthy, Inclusive Communities
* The Augmented Age
* A Truly Global Movement
* The Most Respected Source of Knowledge
* Engaging in the Knowledge Ecosystem

It’s now time for us to consider, debate and weigh each of those. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. What impact would we have on the world if we focused on one of these themes? Which ones go together? We can’t do everything, so what do we have to leave behind? What can we not afford not to do? Who do we need to work with to make this happen?

These are the kinds of questions we must now answer. Strategy is ultimately about making choices and trade-offs, which means that we must decide what goals take precedence over others. This will inevitably lead to some disappointment. Now is the time to make your voice heard about what matters most. Join the online and offline discussions taking place on the five themes, and read up on the research currently being conducted to better understand those not yet in the conversation. Both the discussions and the research will be essential in determining where we focus our attention as a movement through 2030.


Engaging a whole movement
=========================

Building a strategy is hard. Imagine building a shared strategy across a movement of hundreds of thousands of stakeholders, with no direct lines of communication with most of them, no predetermined outcome, and while rebuilding trust and good faith that have been eroded in the past. Imagine building a collaborative strategy from the ground up, in true Wikimedian fashion, through a dialogue happening around the world in dozens of languages.

That's what we did.




Building a strategy is hard, but we are a movement of smart, passionate people obsessed with facts, citations, and intellectual integrity. We have in common a passion for free knowledge and a commitment to serving all human beings.

If anyone can build a collaborative strategy, we can.

Service and Equity
==================

Dozens of groups and organizations have now come together to endorse the Wikimedia movement’s new strategic direction, focused on “Knowledge as a service” and “Knowledge equity”.

The direction is the result of months of discussions, surveys, interviews, and research to better understand the needs of communities, the vision of the movement, and future trends (like misinformation) relevant to the Wikimedia movement and its role in the ecosystem of knowledge.

As a movement, we discussed what we shouldn’t change, what we should improve, and what would change around us. Several themes emerged from the mass of information and were further integrated into successive drafts of the direction. A stable version emerged shortly before the Wikimania conference in August and was discussed extensively online and in Montréal. It was rewritten, revised, refined, and eventually became the final version of the strategic direction.

Beyond developing content as we have done in the past, the resulting direction is composed of two components:

* Knowledge as a service: To serve our users, we will become a platform that serves open knowledge to the world across interfaces and communities. We will build tools for allies and partners to organize and exchange free knowledge beyond Wikimedia. Our infrastructure will enable us and others to collect and use different forms of free, trusted knowledge.
* Knowledge equity: As a social movement, we will focus our efforts on the knowledge and communities that have been left out by structures of power and privilege. We will welcome people from every background to build strong and diverse communities. We will break down the social, political, and technical barriers preventing people from accessing and contributing to free knowledge.

after years of difficult relationships between the Wikimedia Foundation and other actors of the Wikimedia movement, including its affiliates around the world.

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction/Endorsement

On October 26, groups and individuals started declaring their intent to work together towards this future by endorsing the direction. A week later, over 70 groups and organizations have already committed to participating in the next phase in good faith and to define, by Wikimania 2018, how to come to an agreement on roles, responsibilities, and organizational strategies that enable the movement to implement that future.

The signatories include regional chapters from all around the world, thematic organizations, user groups, and the Wikimedia Foundation. Among their comments, some groups have expressed their hopes brought by the direction. CIS-A2K shared their “hopes that the divide between Global North and Global South will be bridged effectively”. The Wikimedians of Bashkortostan endorsed “with hope for more attention to the question of regional languages”. The Wikimedia Community User Group Brasil hopes that the direction “can be a guiding light for the whole movement on the path to healthier and more inclusive communities”.

Individuals called the direction “Outstanding” and hoped for “un futuro como movimiento más equitativo y diverso“. Some even wrote essays about why the process and direction matter to them. A few Wikimedians also expressed their concerns with the text or the process.

Many groups and individuals are now looking forward to the next steps of the process and to making the direction a reality, like Wikimedia Portugal‘s “group of new members committed to collaborate regularly in its implementation”. High-level planning for the next phase has started and will be further developed through November, notably by learning from what worked and didn’t work in the first phase. Some of the upcoming discussions will revolve around “big questions” like movement roles, governance, and decision making, while others will be more goal-oriented and will aim to build organizational strategies and multi-year strategic plans.

For my part: decided to focus on another endeavor as I joined the Wikimedia Foundation's :doc:`Advancement department <wikimedia-advancement>`. I continued to participate in Wikimedia 2030 as a member of the "Revenue Streams" working group, whose mission was to .... I also continued to advise the Wikimedia 2030 core team as needed.
