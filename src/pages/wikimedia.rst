I made my first edit to the French-language Wikipedia in August 2005 to fix a spelling mistake.\ [#firstedit]_ My second edit was to fix a conjugation mistake.\ [#secondedit]_ My third edit was to fix spelling and punctuation mistakes.\ [#thirdedit]_ I guess you could say there was a pattern.



I've been serving the Wikimedia community as a volunteer since 2005 in almost every possible role, from writing Wikipedia articles to giving presentations,


Since then, I have made over 50,000 edits across hundreds of Wikimedia wikis,\ [#editcount]_ and I have spent most of my professional career supporting the Wikimedia movement in various roles.

First steps on the French-language Wikipedia
--------------------------------------------

Most of my early edits were to articles related to my studies and work, like adding content to the article about nanotechnology, adding a schematic to the one about atomic force microscopy, or translating the English-language article about the electrical double layer to French.

I quickly moved on to reverting damaging edits made by vandals, contributing to the *Oracle* (a convivial reference desk-like space), welcoming new users, and participating in community discussions—using a colorfully obnoxious signature.

The Essense of Being Wikipedian
-------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/2012-02-14_Wikipedian_meme.png
   :figwidth: 10em

   Under `CC By-SA 3.0 Unported <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode>`__ by John Blyberg, Mr Thinktank, PierreSelim, Garry Knight, and Louis-Michel van Loo, from `Wikimedia Commons <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedian.png>`__.

Being Wikipedian (essence?): documenting the world, relying on facts and verifiable information, working in harmony (as much as possible) with complete strangers in pursuit of the best encyclopedic content possible, integrating sources and organizing content, information architecture, working across language communities and collaborating with wikipedians from other language editions

not only appealed to me, but I recognized myself in this culture
(link to autistic-wikipedian: many years later, I would get a better understanding of why this mattered so much to me)

Although I titled this section "Becoming Wikipedian", there is an argument that Wikipedians are born, not made.\ [#panciera]_ I may have been a Wikipedian all along; I just didn't know it yet.

In 2006, I gave my first presentation about Wikipedia, :doc:`the first of many <speaking>`. I started becoming more involved in public outreach, workshops, and training. I also started volunteering for `Wikimédia France <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikim%C3%A9dia_France/en>`_, the local chapter, and a few months later I was elected to its Board. The chapter was small and had no paid staff, so this was a "working Board": one whose members take on the work and responsibilities that would traditionally be in the purview of staff.

As a Board member, and later Secretary, I managed membership logistics, engaged donors, and streamlined the Board's decision making process. In addition to a Board member's usual responsibilities around governance, I created and ran an internal newsletter to keep members informed, and organized the chapter's activities into working groups to facilitate the involvement of volunteers.

While at Wikimédia France, I was also a press contact and co-authored a :doc:`book on Wikipedia <writing>` with Florence Devouard.

After a few years of intense involvement, I decided not to seek re-election and to to focus my participation on the global Wikimedia movement.

Volunteer response team (OTRS)
------------------------------

.. figure:: /images/OTRS.svg
   :figwidth: 10em

In early 2007, I joined the `Volunteer Reponse Team <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Volunteer_Response_Team>`_, the team of volunteer Wikimedians who answer the general emails sent to Wikipedia and other Wikimedia sites through the "`Contact us <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contact_us>`_" pages. This group is also referred to as "OTRS agents", from the name of the customer service software we use.

OTRS volunteers respond to thousands of emails every year, while ensuring the confidentiality of the messages and protecting the privacy of the people who email us. Many emails are similar and can be answered using canned responses, but the rest are often related to complex questions or tricky conflicts, which involve research, lengthy back-and-forth, and sometimes mediation.

.. sidebar:: Types of emails handled by the volunteer response team

   "Info" emails are inquiries from the general public, and often function like a service desk to explain how Wikipedia works.

   "Quality" emails focus on issues with the content of articles, and often involve `biographies of living persons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons>`_.

   "Permissions" emails are sent by copyright holders to keep a record of the license terms they are agreeing to when publishing their content (mostly pictures) on Wikimedia sites.

After a few months, I joined the ranks of the Volunteer response team leaders ("OTRS administrators"), which gave me access to advanced tools to manage the various queues, create new ones, manage the access of volunteers, and maintain canned responses. In that capacity, I vetted, recruited, and onboarded new volunteers to respond to email in many languages. I also improved processes so that agents could focus their time on responding to emails.

.. figure:: /images/2011-10-21_Keep-calm-and-click-edit.svg
   :figwidth: 10em

   `Keep calm and click [edit] <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Keep-calm-and-click-edit.svg>`__ based on the `"Keep calm and carry on" meme <http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/keep-calm-and-carry-on>`__.

The OTRS software didn't record administrative actions, so I set up an admin log on the private OTRS wiki for better transparency. I also built a system of templates for canned responses that enabled all OTRS volunteers to edit them on the wiki and suggest changes. Opening the system spread the maintenance of canned responses to all volunteers, thus only requiring administrator access to update the responses in the OTRS software itself.

By 2013, I had been volunteering on OTRS for six years, had responded to hundreds of emails, recruited dozens of new volunteers, and promoted some of them to administrators. Many were very active, and I had shifted my focus to other activities in the Wikimedia movement, so I relinquished my access, confident that the team was in good hands.

Communications, marketing, and documents
----------------------------------------


, creating documents
Wikimedia documents initiative
https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_documents_initiative

Among the many areas in which I volunteered for the Wikimedia movement over the years, I was particularly involved in Communications.

• I created and designed corporate documents and graphics, such as press kits and fundraising documents, and provided visual identity advice.
• I co-managed the Foundation's customer relationship system, and community of 300+ trusted volunteers answering questions and requests about Wikipedia.
• I answered press requests from international news outlets about Wikipedia and its sister sites.

https://wikimania2007.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikimania_2007_Presskit.pdf

The last kind of emails was press requests: emails from journalists and international news outlets.

Wikimedia Chapters conference 2009

In 2009, I was hired by Wikimedia Deutschland, the German chapter, to organize one of the first annual meetings of national Wikimedia chapters in Berlin. Representatives from 23 countries attended the conference, along with Wikimedia Foundation staff.

At that time, I was deeply embedded in the global Wikimedia network, owing to my involvement in governance, committees, mailing lists, and events. Transitioning to a paid position after years of volunteering was exciting, as was the opportunity to work more closely with Wikimedians from all over the world.

I developed as schedule with the participants in advance of the conference, balancing many competing interests and preferences. I also coordinated travel arrangements and subsidies between chapters, to ensure all the groups were represented at the meeting. I coordinated all aspects of the conference, including its budget, documentation, and the hiring of staff.

The conference was a success,\ [#wmconsurvey]_ and went on to be replicated every year since, becoming one of the main venues for the Wikimedia movement to discuss governance, determine strategy, and share experiences.

Multimedia usability project
----------------------------

I joined the Wikimedia Foundation's staff in October 2009 as a `Product Manager for Multimedia Usability <https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Job_openings/Product_Manager_-_Multimedia_Usability>`_ and I relocated to San Francisco.

The Multimedia Usability Project was a special project of the Wikimedia Foundation funded by a $300,000 grant from the `Ford Foundation <https://www.fordfoundation.org/>`_. The project's goal was to increase multimedia participation on Wikimedia sites, to be accomplished primarily through an overhaul of the uploading process to Wikimedia Commons, the central media repository for Wikipedia and its sister sites.

Two main products were delivered as part of the project, both based on extensive user research: a new multi-file upload system for Wikimedia Commons, featuring a wizard-style interface and a temporary holding area; and an illustrated licensing tutorial, explaining the basics of copyright and free licenses in plain language.

We contracted an independent firm to conduct a usability study, which compared the existing and new upload systems. Their results showed an indisputable improvement of the users' experience.

released as main upload tool shortly after the end of the grant period

The Wikimedia Foundation continued the development of UploadWizard beyond this project,

support for campaigns and contests; Wiki Loves Monuments

and to support volunteers worldwide who share multimedia files on Wikimedia Commons.

Guillaume Paumier has been Technical Communications Manager in the Engineering Community Team since early 2011. In this role, he's been instrumental in developing the monthly engineering reports (including all the underlying infrastructure on mediawiki.org), vetting and writing technical blog posts and social media updates, and most recently, co-launching the weekly tech newsletter and keeping it running.


Product & Strategy
------------------

In 2014, I transitioned to a role of Senior Analyst, managing special projects for the Deputy Director & VP of Product & Strategy, and serving as a strategic advisor to the organization and its leadership team.

In practice, this translated to leading initiatives like the File metadata cleanup drive, evaluating content corruption in Wikipedia's new visual editor, and making sense of findings from dozens of academic publications to guide product development.

    What does it mean to be a Senior Analyst? As a long-time Wikimedian (since 2005), Guillaume understands many of Wikimedia's workflows deeply. As a self-confessed OCD introvert, he loves documenting, analyzing; breaking apart things and putting them back together in novel ways. He's awesome at information architecture, and at really thinking through all the options to solve a complex product problem.

    In other words, when I see a product that benefits from deep community expertise, I can throw Guillaume at it and he'll help. :)

File metadata cleanup drive
...........................

The goal of the `File metadata cleanup drive <file-metadata-cleanup-drive>`__ was to increase the number of multimedia files that contained machine-readable metadata on Wikimedia wikis. I created an automated dashboard to measure and identify the files without machine-readable data, and organized community efforts to fix file description pages and tweak license templates.

In three months, the cleanup drive had contributed to eliminating a third of the files missing machine-readable metadata across all wikis, fixing over 800,000 files. Consistent machine-readable metadata will make the migration process to `Structured Data for Commons <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Commons:Structured_data>`__ less tedious, by enabling programs to process most of the files automatically.

VisualEditor research
.....................

In 2015, I supported the VisualEditor team with research and analyses, notably by performing a weekly qualitative review of edits made with VisualEditor, and by analyzing the most cited domains in Wikipedia references.

In October 2015, I started working on a review of the scientific literature in order to build the Wikimedia Research Codex, a living reference guide to the state of scholarly knowledge about Wikipedia, Wikimedia projects and online collaborative communities.

https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Codex


Wikimedia Foundation Values
...........................

In 2016, I co-led an `extensive conversation <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/2016_discussion>`__ to review and identify the Wikimedia Foundation's values. An original set of values had emerged from a soft consensus in 2007.\ [#valueshistory]_ Many employees had expressed confusion about the original set(s) of values and guiding principles, and felt the need for a new organization-wide consultation.

.. [#valueshistory] `History of the Values <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/History>`__ on Wikimedia Meta-Wiki.

Coming up with useful answers starts with asking the right questions, so I developed a `framing for the discussions <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/2016_discussion/Framing>`__, based on academic research, industry practices, and the history of the Wikimedia Foundation. This framing invited the different stakeholders (staff, Board, volunteers) to think deeply about what motivated them to be part of the movement, and helped identify the organization's values as *the  core intrinsic beliefs that drive us towards our vision*.

All the discussions were documented in `anonymized transcripts <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/2016_discussion/Transcripts>`__ from which `several themes <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/2016_discussion/Themes>`__ emerged. They were further refined, crafted, and distilled into five statements that eventually became the `Wikimedia Foundation's values <https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Values>`__.

In 2016–2017, I was one of the Lead Architects of "Wikimedia 2030", an ambitious collaborative strategy process involving dozens of movement organizations and hundreds of individuals. I was key in designing the process and guiding the movement through an intense exercise involving several cycles of community discussions, in-person events, interviews with experts, and commissioned research.

I led the synthesis of the inputs, conversations, and research into several drafts that were further discussed and edited. I was the main author of the Strategic Direction that emerged and went on to be endorsed by nearly a hundred Wikimedia organizations around the world.

The Strategic Direction of "Knowledge Equity and Knowledge as a Service" now serves as the compass for multi-year strategic planning by Wikimedia organizations, and guides decision-making around roles, responsibilities, and resources in the Wikimedia movement.

Advancement
-----------

:doc:`Advancement <wikimedia-advancement>`

In 2018, I joined the Wikimedia Foundation's Advancement department, where I lead special projects for the Chief Advancement Officer, serving as the department's de facto chief of staff.

Current responsibilities in this role include:
* Leading the organization's future thinking towards resilience in a changing world, navigating unknowns in technology, policy, industry, society, and climate, notably through scenario planning.
* Leading Revenue strategy research and development of new revenue models for financial growth and long-term sustainability.
* Collaborating with the Major Gifts & Foundations team on specialized materials and pitches for high-profile prospects, notably a $100 million grant application for MacArthur's 100&Change challenge.
* Staffing the Investment Committee of the Wikimedia Endowment's Board, including portfolio performance.
