   It is easy to take knowledge for granted when you grow up surrounded by it. When I started editing Wikipedia, it was mostly out of curiosity and fascination.

   Curiosity about an encyclopedia that anyone could edit, and about the strange people who would devote their time to sharing knowledge for free.

   Fascination about an opportunity to record the sum of all knowledge, which appealed to my knowledge-hoarder mind.

   But thinking of knowledge as only an abstract concept is a privilege.

   Thinking of Wikipedia as merely a hobby for people with too much time on their hands ignores the opportunity it represents for people who did not grow up surrounded by books.

   Knowledge has real consequences on human lives, both for individuals and for societies.

In 2016–2017, I was a Lead Architect for :doc:`Wikimedia 2030 <wikimedia2030>`, a global, participatory strategy process involving dozens of movement organizations and thousands of individuals. I was key in designing the process and guiding the movement through an intense exercise involving several cycles of community discussions, in-person events, interviews with experts, and commissioned research.

I led the synthesis of all inputs, conversations, and research into several drafts that were further discussed and edited. I was the main author of the Strategic Direction that emerged and went on to be endorsed by nearly a hundred Wikimedia organizations around the world.

The Strategic Direction of "Knowledge Equity and Knowledge as a Service" now serves as the compass for multi-year strategic planning by Wikimedia organizations, and guides decision-making around roles, responsibilities, and resources in the Wikimedia movement.

   a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.

.. container:: identity-intro

   I recognized myself early on in the Wikipedia vision of collecting and sharing "the sum of all knowledge." Wikipedians document the world, relying on facts and verifiable information, working in harmony (as much as possible) with complete strangers in pursuit of the best encyclopedic content possible. They integrate sources and organize content, working across language communities and collaborating with other Wikipedians around the world.

   But being a Wikipedian isn't just about being modern Diderots, however noble that is. Free knowledge is about :doc:`so much more <stakes-of-knowledge>`. And the process through which that sum of knowledge is developed is what makes it so valuable; that's why, over the years, I have studied the history of Wikipedia, and sought to better understand its culture and identity.

A culture of sensemaking
------------------------

.. figure:: /images/2012-02-14_Wikipedian_meme.png

   Humor is part of the Wikipedia culture. This collage was my take on the "What people think I do / What I really do" meme, which "depict[s] a range of preconceptions associated with a particular field of occupation or expertise" and "compares varying impressions about one's profession held by others, self-image and the often mundane reality of the job." (from `Know Your Meme <https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-people-think-i-do-what-i-really-do>`__). Images by John Blyberg, Mr Thinktank, PierreSelim, Garry Knight, and Louis-Michel van Loo, on `Wikimedia Commons <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedian.png>`__ // `CC BY-SA 3.0 <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode>`__.

Wikipedians have a unique affinity and talent for collecting and curating free, reliable knowledge. In a world of information overload, bias, and misinformation, they provide discernment, sensemaking, and human judgment on information, which all contributes to building trust.

This is something I started to ponder `back in 2010 </fr/articles/reference-necessaire/>`__ (fr) when I mused about how Wikipedians' habit of adding reliable sources to Wikipedia articles was seeping into many other areas of their lives, something I had experienced myself when I was writing my :doc:`Ph.D. thesis <phd>`: the jury said they had never read such a well-referenced and well-structured thesis. This realization finally crystallized much later as I was reflecting on the Wikimedia Foundation's :doc:`revenue strategy <wikimedia-revenue-strategy>` and identifying sustainable differentiators of Wikipedia.

.. class:: emphasis

   Wikipedians organize, weigh, and nuance facts; as a collective, they constitute a formidable sensemaking engine. Wikipedia, as a website, is merely the current manifestation and artifact of that ethos.


Stating our Values
------------------

.. figure:: /images/2018-01-26_Values_All-hands_9688_v1.jpg

   My colleagues in the Foundation's Talent & Culture team have been leading the efforts to bring those values to life and integrate them into the employee life cycle, from hiring to onboarding and performance evaluation. In 2018, we organized a workshop to invite employees to express how they approached the values in their work. They did so through a variety of media ranging from poetry to mixed media, dance, clay, or just plain discussion.

I had another opportunity to understand what brings Wikipedians together in 2016, when I co-led an `extensive conversation <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/2016_discussion>`__ to discuss and identify the Wikimedia Foundation's values. I developed a `framing for the discussions <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Values/2016_discussion/Framing>`__, based on academic research, industry practices, and the history of the Wikimedia Foundation. This framing invited the different stakeholders (staff, Board, volunteers) to think deeply about what motivated them to be part of the movement, and helped identify the organization's values as "the core intrinsic beliefs that drive us towards our vision."

In the end, this project was also an opportunity for me to better understand my own motivations and values. As we were writing the `final set of values <https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/values/>`__, I realized how closely my own beliefs resonated with them, and why I felt so much at home at Wikimedia.


History and wikiarchaeology
---------------------------

.. figure:: /images/andrew-neel-1-29wyvvLJA-unsplash.jpg

   `Andrew Neel <https://unsplash.com/@andrewtneel>`__ on `Unsplash <https://unsplash.com/photos/1-29wyvvLJA>`__

Another pillar of the Wikipedia culture is its insistence on keeping a history of nearly everything. Some of this custom originates in the wiki platform itself: when anyone can edit the site and change its content immediately for all subsequent visitors of a page, it is necessary to keep a diligent history, if only to be able to undo malicious or misguided changes.

The obsession of Wikipedians with documentation and record-keeping is both a blessing and a curse when it comes to studying the history of the Wikimedia movement. A blessing because hardly anything ever disappears completely from the archives of the site. A curse because the overabundance of historical artifacts and documents makes wikiarchaeology a relentless exercise in endurance, perseverance, and often luck.

As someone who has been part of the Wikimedia movement for a long time, I consider it my responsibility to help preserve its collective history and institutional memory. Remembering history isn't just a crucial part of staying true to who we are; the study of history is also how we make sense of the past and understand how events and decisions, both good and bad, have shaped our present.

My commitment to understanding and preserving Wikipedia's collective history has manifested in several ways over the years. For example, in 2013, I produced an :doc:`interactive timeline <wikipedia-2013-timeline>` to serve as a retrospective of what had happened across the Wikimedia movement that year. In 2018, I led a workshop for the Wikimedia Foundation's :doc:`Advancement team <wikimedia-advancement>` to spark the transmission of knowledge. Old-timers shared stories and memories that they thought newcomers would find of interest, and newcomers asked old-timers questions from a fresh perspective.

In 2012, I gave a talk at Wikimania, the annual Wikipedia conference, entitled "Eleven years of Wikipedia, or the Wikimedia history crash course you can edit." The presentation consisted of a large chronological infographic through which I walked the audience. I also printed the graphic on a large poster and invited the participants to correct or expand its content throughout the conference, in true Wikipedia fashion.

Product & Technology
====================

.. figure:: /images/Presse_Marinoni_8863_banner.jpg
   :alt: Close-up on the gears of Marinoni's printing machine

.. container:: product-tech-intro

   I dedicated my first few years at the Wikimedia Foundation to improving the technical platform that makes Wikipedia possible.

   As a Product Manager, I sought to understand the needs of Wikipedia contributors and translate them into product requirements that could be implemented by developers.

   As a technical writer, I translated techspeak into communications for multiple audiences on a wide spectrum of specialized technical expertise, ranging from technical reports to corporate communications to newsletters for casual Wikipedia contributors.

   As a Senior Analyst, I stepped in to lead time-sensitive initiatives and strategic research critical to the Foundation's product development efforts.

   These roles enabled me to bring together my skills as an engineer, writer, and researcher, to solve complex problems creatively, and to fulfill my need for interdisciplinary work that spans fields and social groups.

..

    "Guillaume understands many of Wikimedia's workflows deeply. ... he loves documenting, analyzing, breaking apart things and putting them back together in novel ways. He's awesome at information architecture, and at really thinking through all the options to solve a complex product problem."

    --- `Erik Möller <https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimediaannounce-l/2014-October/000993.html>`__, Deputy Director & VP of Product & Strategy (2014).

Product strategy
----------------

Prior to leading the Wikimedia 2030 strategy effort, I managed special projects for the Wikimedia Foundation's Deputy Director, and served as a strategic advisor to the organization and its leadership team.

In practice, this meant leading initiatives like the :doc:`File metadata cleanup drive <file-metadata-cleanup-drive>`. The high number of files missing machine-readable copyright information was blocking the wide release of MediaViewer, the plugin that opens images in full screen on Wikipedia pages. The plugin needed to be able to read the copyright information from the images to comply with license requirements. I created an automated dashboard to measure and identify the files with unreadable data, and organized community efforts to fix them. In three months, the cleanup drive had contributed to eliminating a third of the unreadable files across all wikis, fixing over 800,000 files.

.. figure:: /images/2014-09-11_MrMetadata-screenshot.png

   I coded an online tool in Python to query tens of millions of multimedia files across all Wikimedia sites and check that their copyright information was easily accessible by automated programs.

In this role, I also produced a research report on the `roles performed by Wikipedia contributors <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Codex/Roles_of_contributors>`__, based on a literature review of over a hundred scientific publications. The report helped product managers and designers understand scholarly knowledge about Wikipedia and online communities in a language that spoke to them. In addition, I supported the VisualEditor team with quality assurance research to identify critical software bugs, and analyzed the most cited websites in Wikipedia references to improve automated citation formatting. Those efforts enabled the team to move forward with a wider release of the visual editor to Wikipedia contributors.

Multimedia usability project
----------------------------

.. container:: figures

   .. figure:: /images/upwiz.png
      :figclass: framed-img


      As a Product Manager, I led the development of UploadWizard, a multi-file upload system  designed to make it easier for contributors to upload pictures to Wikipedia. It has now been used to upload over 20 million files.

   .. figure:: /images/2010-11-05_Licensing_tutorial_en.png
      :figclass: framed-img

      I worked with a graphic artist to develop an illustrated tutorial explaining the basics of copyright law and free licensing to new contributors.

.. TODO: :doc:`UploadWizard <uploadwizard>`

I first joined the Wikimedia Foundation's staff in October 2009 as a Product Manager for Multimedia Usability. The `Multimedia Usability Project <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_usability_project_report>`__ was a special project to increase multimedia participation on Wikimedia sites, through an overhaul of the uploading process to Wikimedia Commons, the central media repository for all language editions of Wikipedia. The two-person team was funded by a $300,000 grant from the `Ford Foundation <https://www.fordfoundation.org/>`__.

Two main products were delivered as part of the project, both based on extensive user research: a new multi-file upload system for Wikimedia Commons, featuring a wizard-style interface; and an illustrated licensing tutorial, explaining the basics of copyright and free licenses in plain language. More features were added after the completion of the grant, notably to support campaigns and contests like Wiki Loves Monuments, a worldwide contest that was recognized by the  Guinness Book of Records as the largest photography competition.

As of February 2020, UploadWizard has been used to upload over 20 million files to Wikimedia Commons.


Technical writing
-----------------

.. container:: figures

   .. figure:: /images/2012-02-09_Open_advice_books_8098s.jpg

      I contributed a chapter on User Experience to the *Open Advice* book, a collection of essays, stories and lessons learned by members of the Free Software community.

   .. figure:: /images/2013-06-12_tech_news_en.png
      :figclass: framed-img

      Tech News, a weekly technical newsletter I created in 2013 for Wikipedia contributors, has now been running for seven years and has been instrumental in improving relationships between engineering staff and Wikipedia communities.

.. /images/2014-01-02_Technews_screen.png

Transparency is a guiding principle of the Wikimedia Foundation: it ensures that the organization is accountable about its activities to the general public and its donors, and that Wikipedia contributors have a say in changes that affect them on the site.

As Technical Communications Manager, I was responsible for assembling, editing, and publishing the monthly engineering reports covering technical activities for the whole organization. I was also the editor of the Wikimedia Tech Blog, writing and editing technical blog posts on a variety of topics from software updates to data center migrations.

.. JD: https://foundation.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Job_openings/Technical_Communications_Manager&oldid=87984

.. later: :doc:`Technical writing <technical-communications-wikimedia>`

During that period, I authored :doc:`a few book chapters <writing>`. One detailed the architecture of MediaWiki, the software that powers Wikipedia, for inclusion in *The Architecture of Open Source Applications, volume 2*. Another one, on the topic of user experience, was included in *Open Advice*, a collection of essays, stories and lessons learned by members of the Free Software community.

In 2013, I started :doc:`Tech News <wikimedia-tech-news>`, a weekly technical newsletter for Wikipedia contributors. Written in intentionally simple language, its goal was to inform Wikipedians without specialized technical knowledge about software changes that might affect them. I worked with volunteers to translate the newsletter in about a dozen languages every week, and wrote a Lua script to distribute multilingual newsletters. The newsletter, now managed by the Community Liaisons team, has been running for seven years and has been instrumental in improving relationships between engineering staff and Wikipedia communities.

Wikimédia France
----------------

In 2006, I gave my first presentation about Wikipedia, :doc:`the first of many <speaking>`. I started becoming more involved in public outreach, workshops, and training. I also started volunteering for `Wikimédia France <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikim%C3%A9dia_France/en>`_, the local Wikimedia chapter, and a few months later I was elected to its Board. The chapter was small and had no paid staff, so Board members took on the work and responsibilities that would traditionally be in the purview of staff.

As a Board member, and later also Secretary, I focused on transparency, efficiency, and community organizing at the local level: I managed membership logistics, engaged donors, and streamlined the Board's decision making process. In addition to a Board member's usual responsibilities around governance, I also created an internal newsletter to keep members informed, and organized the chapter's activities into working groups to facilitate the involvement of volunteers.


Wikimedia Chapters conference 2009
----------------------------------

In 2009, I moved on to Community organizing at the global level, and organized one of the first annual meetings of national Wikimedia chapters, on behalf of Wikimedia Deutschland. Representatives from 23 countries and the Wikimedia Foundation attended the conference in Berlin. I developed the conference's program in advance with the participants, balancing competing interests and navigating movement politics. I also coordinated travel arrangements and subsidies between chapters, to ensure that all the groups were represented at the meeting.

The conference was a success, and went on to be replicated every year since. Now called the Wikimedia Summit, it has become one of the main venues for the Wikimedia movement to discuss governance, determine strategy, and share experiences.

   Among the many areas in which I volunteered for the Wikimedia movement over the years, I was particularly involved in Communications.

   I created and designed corporate documents and graphics, such as press kits and fundraising prospectuses, and provided visual identity advice.

   I also answered press requests from international news outlets about Wikipedia and its sister sites at a time when Wikipedia was not as well-respected and understood as it is today.

   I co-managed the Foundation's customer relationship system, and community of 300+ trusted volunteers answering questions and requests about Wikipedia.


Volunteer response team (OTRS)
------------------------------

In 2007, I joined the `Volunteer Response Team <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Volunteer_Response_Team>`_ who answers the emails sent to Wikipedia by the general public. This group is also referred to as "OTRS agents," after the name of the customer service software we use. OTRS volunteers respond to thousands of emails every year, while ensuring the confidentiality of the messages and protecting the privacy of the people who email us. Many emails are similar and can be answered using canned responses, but the rest are often related to complex questions or tricky conflicts, which involve research, lengthy back-and-forth, and sometimes mediation.

After a few months, I became a team leader ("OTRS administrator"), which gave me access to advanced tools to manage queues, volunteers, and canned responses. In that capacity, I vetted, recruited, and onboarded dozens of new volunteers to respond to email in many languages. I also improved processes so that agents could focus their time on responding to emails.


Crosswiki service work

For a few years, I served as a member of the Wikimedia “`Stewards <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/stewards>`__,” a handful of individuals entrusted with wide-ranging powers across the different language versions of Wikipedia and its sister sites.

Stewards have the sensitive ability to grant and remove rights on any of the hundreds of thousands of user accounts across wikis, as well complete access to the software interface on all wikis. Use of those powers is regulated through policy. Although most of a steward's work is routine, they occasionally intervene in case of emergencies, like rampant vandalism or a rogue administrator abusing their tools.

Serving as a steward and as part of the `Small Wiki Monitoring Team <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Small_Wiki_Monitoring_Team>`__ gave me an opportunity to work with contributors from a variety of languages and backgrounds over the years. I was left with a deep appreciation for their work, particularly in communities with few native speakers.

Editing Wikipedia

volunteer contributions: articles, photos, etc.

I made my first edit to the French-language Wikipedia in August 2005 to fix a spelling mistake.\ [#firstedit]_ My second edit was to fix a conjugation mistake.\ [#secondedit]_ My third edit was to fix spelling and punctuation mistakes.\ [#thirdedit]_ I guess you could say there was a pattern.

Since then, I have made over 50,000 edits across hundreds of Wikimedia wikis, and I have spent most of my professional career supporting the Wikimedia movement in various roles. I still occasionally made the odd edit when I come across something I can fix on a Wikipedia page.

First steps on the French-language Wikipedia
--------------------------------------------

Most of my early edits were to articles related to my studies and work, like adding content to the article about nanotechnology, adding a schematic to the one about atomic force microscopy, or translating the English-language article about the electrical double layer to French.

I quickly moved on to reverting damaging edits made by vandals, contributing to the *Oracle* (a convivial reference desk-like space), welcoming new users, and participating in community discussions—using a colorfully obnoxious signature.
