    I value privacy and I pledge to respect yours.

This site doesn't use any third-party statistics or analytics tool such
as Google Analytics.

In order to find a compromise between privacy and basic statistics to
help me improve the site, I have chosen to use an open-source software
called `Piwik <http://piwik.org>`__ that is self-hosted on my server.

Piwik can be used `in compliance with German privacy protection
laws <http://piwik.org/blog/2011/03/piwik-can-be-used-in-compliance-with-data-protection-laws/>`__,
which are some of the most stringent in the world. I have configured it
to anonymize your data by removing the two rightmost bytes in visitor IP
addresses logs.

The information you volunteer to disclose when you comment (e.g. your
name, or pseudonym, and your e-mail address) is stored in a database,
along with your IP address. Your private information (like your e-mail
and IP address) will never be disclosed, shared or sold to
third-parties, unless required to do so by law.

I avoid loading remote content from third-party sites in order not to
leak your visits to them; there are rare cases where this is inevitable,
for example when embedding a video. In those cases, I'll do my best to
let you opt-in to load and display this external content. Videos embedded from YouTube use "`Privacy-enhanced mode <https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en>`__," meaning that YouTube doesn't set cookies unless you play the video.


Opting out completely
=====================

In case you deem these privacy protection settings insufficient, you may elect to opt out of Piwik completely by setting up a non-tracking opt-out cookie (see below), or enabling the "Do Not Track" option in your web browser. Note that this cannot affect remote loading of resources hosted on other sites.
