    Hello! I’m Guillaume.


I'm a science Ph.D, a photographer and a master of organization & optimization. For fun, I travel, I put things into boxes and I play Lego.

For the more serious stuff, you can refer to the obligatory third-person biography below, released in the public domain. Feel free to steal from it shamelessly.
