.. highlights::

   In 2016–2017, I was a Lead Architect for Wikimedia 2030, a global, participatory strategy process involving dozens of movement organizations and thousands of individuals. I was key in designing the process and guiding the movement through an intense exercise involving several cycles of community discussions, in-person events, interviews with experts, and commissioned research.

   I led the synthesis of all inputs, conversations, and research into several drafts that were further discussed and edited. I was the main author of the Strategic Direction that emerged and went on to be endorsed by hundred Wikimedia organizations around the world.

   The Strategic Direction of "Knowledge Equity and Knowledge as a Service" now serves as the compass for multi-year strategic planning by Wikimedia organizations, and guides decision-making around roles, responsibilities, and resources in the Wikimedia movement.

"Your mission, should you choose to accept it ..."

We chose to do this not because it was easy.
--------------------------------------------

Building a strategy is hard. Imagine building a shared strategy across a movement of hundreds of thousands of stakeholders, with no direct line of communication with most of them, no predetermined outcome, and while rebuilding trust and good faith that have been eroded in the past. Imagine building a collaborative strategy from the ground up, in true Wikipedian fashion, through a dialogue happening around the world in dozens of languages.

That's what we did.

We didn't know how we were going to do it. We didn't know how it was going to go. We didn't know what the result was going to be. We did it anyway, because it was the only way to build trust and alignment across the movement.

Building a strategy is hard, but we are a movement of smart, passionate people obsessed with facts, citations, and intellectual integrity. We have in common a passion for free knowledge and a commitment to serving all human beings. If anyone could build a collaborative strategy, we could.

And so it began. We put together a team. We designed a process, and adjusted it many times. Our aim was to identify a common strategic direction that would unite and inspire people across our movement on our way to 2030, and help us make decisions. I was a Lead Architect in the small core team driving this process,\ [#CoreTeam]_ along with other employees of the Wikimedia Foundation and in the movement, and the folks at williamsworks.\ [#Williamsworks]_

Building alignment
------------------

Fast forward a little under a year, and dozens of groups and organizations endorsed the new strategic direction, focused on "Knowledge as a service" and "Knowledge equity."\ [#StrategicDirection]_

Several themes emerged from the mass of information and were further integrated into successive drafts of the direction. A stable version emerged shortly before the Wikimania conference in August, and was discussed extensively online and in Montréal. I rewrote it, revised it, refined it, and it eventually became the final version of the strategic direction.

After years of tensions between the Wikimedia Foundation and other actors of the Wikimedia movement, groups and individuals started declaring their intent to work together towards this future by endorsing the direction. In less than a week, over 70 groups and organizations had already endorsed it; they had committed to participating in the next phase in good faith and to come to an agreement on roles, responsibilities, and organizational strategies that would enable the movement to implement that future. In the end nearly 100 groups and organizations signed on, representing an unprecedented alignment in the history of the Wikimedia movement.\ [#Endorsements]_

A broad direction for the movement
----------------------------------

We started from a simple question: *What do we want to build or achieve together by 2030?* The strategic direction was not meant to be a strategic plan. Plans are usually for 3–5 years, executable and measurable, specific to organizational capacity and resources. The direction needed to be broad, enduring, ambitious, and clear enough to provide guidance on overarching goals against which a specific plan could be built. Using 2030 as a time horizon enabled us to untangle our aspirations from our more immediate roles and interests, and let our imagination roam more freely.

From on-wiki discussions, to large conferences, to small meetups, to expert interviews, to desk and field research, the process was exhaustive, messy, and fascinating. It did not take long to confirm that the greatest strength of the Wikimedia movement is the talent, dedication, and integrity of its members. We are all part of this movement because we share a belief that :doc:`free knowledge makes the world a better place <stakes-of-knowledge>`.

Wikimedia 2030 was arguably the largest participatory process the Wikimedia movement had ever undertaken. For several months, the movement buzzed with activity, as people went through cycles of discussion online and in-person, and converged towards the direction.

To ensure a rich discussion and a legitimate outcome, we intentionally reached out to "new voices." They were not just people outside the movement, but also people *within* the movement who didn't traditionally participate in this kind of discussions. We contracted eighteen coordinators to organize and facilitate discussions in many languages, with support from the Foundation's Community Engagement team. Volunteers and groups also organized discussions with their communities and affiliates across wikis and off-wiki. This encouraged many contributors to participate in the discussion by avoiding the "Not my wiki" effect.\ [#NotMyWiki]_

All those discussions and research projects produced massive amounts of notes, reports, and documentation,  so that anyone could follow facts and decisions to their source, and to make it easier for people joining the process later to catch up.\ [#2030Reports]_

Amplifying new voices

As we were looking at the trends to consider, we also needed to go beyond what we knew, and who we were familiar with. Our vision requires that we realize that we're not alone. We're part of an ecosystem, and we need others. We need partners. Those voices will help define our future, because they're part of it.

This work involved hundreds of interviews, small-group discussions ("salons"), research, and building relationships for future collaboration. The Foundation notably partnered with Reboot in Indonesia and Brazil,\ [#Reboot]_ to conduct research complementary to what was done with the New Readers program in countries where Wikimedia wasn't well known.\ [#NewReaders]_ They interviewed partners, subject matter experts, and conducted contextual inquiries with readers in their own environment using methods of design research. In parallel, they also conducted online surveys in the places where we were the most popular, to understand how people perceive and use Wikimedia.



This work informed and complemented community discussions with new voices that hadn't traditionally been included in strategy discussions, or that were not yet part of the movement. They helped us identify the global trends that we needed to consider as we discussed our future.

The Foundation couldn't do this alone; we are a global and distributed movement, and local relationships are much more likely to bear fruit than a centralized approach. The Foundation also reserved budget for affiliates to run small-group discussions with subject matter experts.

Roads, bridges, and villages
----------------------------

Wikimania, the annual conference of Wikimedians, was the first opportunity for the Wikimedia movement to discuss the draft strategic direction. The conference in Montréal was a chance to celebrate the concrete artifact borne out of months of intense online discussions, and to continue the conversations in person. Of course, only a small part of the Wikimedia movement ever attends the conference, so we also sought feedback in many other forums as well, including smaller regional meetups.

When drafting this first version of the strategic direction, I chose intentionally simple language for several reasons. One was that volunteers and affiliates often find the language used by the Foundation too jargony and full of corporate buzzwords.\ [#WritingClearly]_ I wanted the language of the direction to resonate with people regardless of their affiliation in the movement, and I wanted people to feel like they could have written those words themselves.

I had another goal for using simple language and relying on metaphors: I wanted the strategic direction to be easily translatable to other languages and cultural contexts. It was reasonable to assume that all languages had ways to convey universal meanings like "roads," "bridges," "villages," "journey," "tools," "shapes," and "colors:"

  The strategic direction of the Wikimedia movement for 2030 is to become the roads, bridges, and villages that support the world’s journey towards free knowledge. We, the Wikimedia movement, will forge the tools and build the foundations for creating and accessing trusted knowledge in many shapes and colors. ...\ [#DirectionWikimania]_

The "roads and bridges" were a direct reference to Nadia Eghbal's excellent research report for the Ford Foundation, in which she described the importance of the free and open-source code infrastructure "on which all of digital society relies."\ [#EghbalRoadsBridges]_ I used the same metaphor to describe the knowledge infrastructure that Wikimedia was aspiring to, and added the "villages" to highlight the central role of communities in the movement.

.. [#WritingClearly] "The tolerance people might have for jargon and buzzwords in their everyday life won't be there online. People want to understand what the Foundation are doing and how it'll change what they do as an editor or improve the experience for readers, not whether it satisfies a key performance indicator." `Writing clearly <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Writing_clearly>`__. Meta-Wiki essay.

Converging on a shared direction
--------------------------------

As it turned out, many Wikimedians found the metaphors to be too "flowery" and "poetic," too far removed from the seriousness of their endeavor. Some also took offense at the comparison to villages; they explained that in their culture, small settlements have a negative connotation of backwardness and stagnation, and that real change and advancement happens in cities. When I rewrote the direction to integrate all the feedback, I took this into account and decided to use more precise (and complex) words like "infrastructure" and "ecosystem" instead, and to explain how to translate those concepts instead of translating words.\ [#TranslateExt]_

.. class:: rowspan-2
.. [#TranslateExt] Translation of pages on Wikimedia sites happens through the "Translate extension," a dedicated tool built for the MediaWiki software. When preparing pages for translation, an author may add "message documentation" to provide additional context to translators about a particular sentence or paragraph. I used this feature to describe concepts like "the essential infrastructure" ("idea of a backbone, foundation. Something that allows something to stand up; Something upon which one builds something else") and "ecosystem" ("idea of an organic, dynamic group, network, or environment, with many components that have effects on each other and sometimes depend on each other"). See `Example of message documentation for the first paragraph of the Strategic Direction <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Translations:Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Direction/182/qqq>`__, Meta-Wiki, 2017.

Some Wikimedians found the Wikimania draft to focus too much on technical infrastructure and tools. A first attempt at better highlighting the human aspect of the movement left others feeling that the technical aspects were not emphasized enough. We eventually settled on a strategic direction that acknowledged the duality of our movement as a complex socio-technical system, and painted the vision of a future to which everyone could contribute.

.. TODO: Knowledge Equity and Knowledge as a service

.. TODO: add paragraph about endorsements. I worked with Nicole Ebber, who was leading and coordinating our work with "organized groups" across the movement (meaning chapters, user groups, and other affiliates).

Some of the upcoming discussions will revolve around “big questions” like movement roles, governance, and decision making, while others will be more goal-oriented and will aim to build organizational strategies and multi-year strategic plans.

For my part: decided to focus on another endeavor as I joined the Wikimedia Foundation's :doc:`Advancement department <advancement>`. I continued to participate in Wikimedia 2030 as a member of the "Revenue Streams" working group, whose mission was to .... I also continued to advise the Wikimedia 2030 core team as needed.

I was not done thinking about the future though. Taking the long view. :doc:`2031 scenarios <2031-scenarios>`
