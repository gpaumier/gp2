    I currently lead special projects for the Wikimedia Foundation's Chief Advancement Officer, serving as the department's de facto chief of staff. In this role, I am leading the organization's future thinking towards resilience in a changing world, navigating unknowns in technology, policy, industry, society, and climate, notably through scenario planning.

    I lead Revenue Strategy research and the development of new revenue models for financial growth and long-term sustainability. I also provide expertise and guidance to other teams in the Advancement department, notably the Major Gifts team.

The importance of Revenue Strategy for the Wikimedia Foundation lies in two main factors: the uncertain future facing us, which might endanger existing revenue sources, and the impetus to grow, mandated by the ambitions of the Wikimedia movement.

The :doc:`Strategic direction for 2030 <wikimedia2030>`, which I led, set out ambitious aspirations for the Wikimedia movement, aspirations not attainable with the resources currently at our disposal. In 2018 the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees, recognizing this gap, `mandated the Foundation <https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2018-January/089500.html>`__ to "invest the resources necessary to support the growth and evolution required for the next chapter of Wikimedia’s future."

Their `Statement endorsing future resourcing and direction of the organization <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard/November_2017_-_Statement_endorsing_future_resourcing_and_direction_of_the_organization>`__ specifically recommended that the Foundation "support the fundraising team in raising additional funds beyond what is called for in the annual plan to prepare us for future growth," "increase revenue as needed to support investment and growth," and "explore alternative revenue streams for the Foundation and movement."

Following this directive, I started working with Lisa Seitz-Gruwell, the Foundation's Chief Advancement Officer, as well as Jeremy Gregg, from `Gregg Partners <https://greggpartners.com/>`__, to explore new revenue streams for the Wikimedia Foundation. In addition to specific proposals, I also published a :doc:`strategic summary <wikimedia-revenue-strategy>` of my reflection. Last, I worked with Megan Hernandez, the Foundation's VP of Advancement, to develop recommendations as part of the movement-focused `Revenue Streams working group <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2018-20/Working_Groups/Revenue_Streams>`__.


Long-term thinking
==================

Revenue Strategy goes beyond medium-term plans for new revenue streams. A central part of my work is to think about the longer term and the trends, risks, and unknowns that might have an impact on the organization. I do this not just by reading across many fields, but also by using imagination and making connections across disciplines. Human systems are deeply interconnected and taking a wider view avoids tunnel vision, while imagination avoids focusing only on known elements.

For example, in 2019 I produced three :doc:`Scenarios for 2031 <2031-scenarios>` to imagine possible futures for the world and Wikimedia's place in it. The scenarios all contained both favorable and unfavorable story elements, to ensure the people engaging with them wouldn't be tempted to pick one as the future they favored. I used the scenarios to spark discussions and shift conversations from day-to-day concerns and busywork to longer-term strategic thinking.

In a workshop with Advancement staff, I created cards, representing story elements of the scenarios, to encourage long-term thinking while tapping into the participants' own expertise and imagination. "Black swan" cards introduced halfway through the activity forced the participants to contend with unpredictable, "wild card" events and how their draft strategies would fare in those new circumstances.

Future-oriented thinking helps build resilience by shifting the perspective of the organization's leaders to the long view, and leading them to imagine the future consequences of current events and choices they make today.


Major Gifts, Foundation, and Endowment
======================================

Last, in my current role, I also work with other teams in Advancement, for example providing expertise and guidance to the Strategic Partnerships team, and the Major Gifts, Foundation, and Endowment team.

In addition to staffing the Investment Committee of the Endowment Board, I produce specialized materials and occasionally meet with donors. I have crafted proposals tailored to high-net-worth prospects and created a modular prospectus aimed for a wider audience. I also co-wrote the Wikimedia Foundation's application for the `100&Change challenge <https://www.100andchange.org/>`__, including what would become my essay on the :doc:`Stakes of Knowledge <stakes-of-knowledge>`.
