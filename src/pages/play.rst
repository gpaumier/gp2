   I like to do things with my hands and move my body around. Whether it's building things, folding paper, hiking, tending to plants, lifting heavy weights, doing pirouettes, belting out songs, or kneading bread, it provides an escape from intellectual work and intense thinking. I like to let my mind wander; it's often when I focus on my body and let my brain work out problems subconsciously that epiphanies happen. Playfulness and fun are great sources of inspiration and creativity.

Mind-wandering

One thousand cranes

According to Japanese legend, someone who folds a thousand origami cranes is granted a wish by the gods, or eternal happiness and good luck. In my case, I had just moved to a new place during a difficult personal time. I was looking for a way to keep myself busy that would require some focus while allowing my mind to wander. So I started folding cranes.

I folded about 750 cranes in 2018, a hundred throughout 2019, and finished the last 150 during the 2020 pandemic. I strung them up according to various color patterns, and assembled them all into a full *senbazuru* (千羽鶴). Folding the cranes helped me process what I needed to process, and seeing them on display often brings back feelings of perseverance, aesthetics, and resilience.

Coloring books

Another activity that encourages mind-wandering is coloring books. Coloring requires focus while simultaneously offering complete freedom in the choice of colors. When the outside world feels like too much, coloring books are a way for me to retreat into a quieter bubble for a little while.

In a world of climate catastrophe, rising nationalism, systemic oppression, end-stage capitalism, and widespread injustice, allowing yourself to be absorbed in coloring a mandala for a couple of hours is a great way to reset and return, if even briefly, to mental homeostasis.

Building LEGO sets was probably my favorite activity as a kid. I rediscovered them as an adult, and along with them the joy of turning random bricks into a finished artifact. Since then, I have accumulated a little collection of sets, from cute botanical sets to fancy display pieces to storytelling-rich scenes. I am currently designing some homemade creations as well.

I also like to build new things, often for a functional purpose. Several homes ago, I built a modular home office with shelves out of Ikea poles and wood planks. More recently, I built a platform to anchor a squat rack that serves as a home gym. I also built a modular deadlift platform out of lumber and plywood, which I can adjust for block pulls and deficit deadlifts. As of 2022, I'm slowly getting into more ambitious woodworking projects, partly motivated by the need to store books from my ever-expanding personal library.

After I moved (back) to the US, I was having trouble finding good bread. Having grown up and lived in France for most of my life, I was unhappy with the limited options available in the small California town where I was living.

In 2017, I took a few days off work to participate in a breadmaking workshop at the San Francisco Baking Institute.\ [#sfbi]_ For five days, I learned the theory and practice of flour types, yeast, preferments, gluten, shaping, scoring, steaming, and baking loaves. At the end of the day, I would bring all the bread I had made that day to the Wikimedia office, to the delight of my food-loving colleagues.

For a while after that, I made different kinds of bread at home, with a preference for ciabatta (for its simplicity) and brioche (for its festiveness). Later, I moved to the city and found a great bakery that made excellent bread, so convenience won. I ventured back into my breadmaking ways during the 2020 pandemic.

Other things I like to bake are apple cobblers, marble cakes, and other simple French cakes that remind me of family baking during the weekends when I was younger.

.. [#sfbi] The `SFBI <https://sfbi.com/>`__ was founded in 1996 by Michel Suas, a fellow Frenchman. The workshop was led by Miyuki Togi, who combined deep exertise, geniality, and patience.

I am putting this last because while it does relate to fun and creativity, it's also more of an intellectual activity than what I have listed above. I love to read and learn, and I've accumulated a sizable and ever-growing `personal library <https://www.librarything.com/catalog/gpaumier>`__. My interests are extremely varied, and you would be hard-pressed to find an overarching theme for my collection.

I used to find the piles of unread books daunting, until I learned about Umberto Eco's antilibrary\ [#antilibrary]_ and decided to embrace tsundoku.\ [#tsundoku]_ Being surrounded by books now brings me comfort rather than guilt. I do manage to read some of them once in a while.\ [#ReadingLog]_ I like having the opportunity to learn about so many topics, the books at my fingertips, waiting for the right moment of inspiration.

.. [#antilibrary] `Umberto Eco’s Antilibrary: Why Unread Books Are More Valuable to Our Lives than Read Ones <https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/>`__. Maria Popova. The Marginalian, 2015.

.. [#tsundoku] `Tsundoku <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku>`__ (積ん読) is Japanese slang for the practice of "acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them."

.. [#ReadingLog] In the past few years, I have kept a `reading log <https://github.com/gpaumier/reading-log>`__ to track my progress. I hope to one day build an interactive visualization using this data, inspired by Marey's famous train schedule.
