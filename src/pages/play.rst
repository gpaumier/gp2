   placeholder: playfulness, creativity, inspired, fun, wonder,

   We are inspired.

   We are guided by a vision of a better world. We are taking on a huge challenge. We revere what has come before and are in awe of the work ahead. It brings us hope. It fills us with wonder.

   When we are inspired, we play and laugh together. It’s not about one big party, it’s about making space for new ideas and new connections, making space for creativity. Inquisitiveness arises when we’re having fun. It’s ok to wonder, to ponder. We don’t need to take ourselves too seriously.

   When we are inspired, we do excellent work.

Two years ago, I moved to a new place during a difficult time. I wanted to find a way to keep myself busy that would require some focus while allowing my mind to wander. I decided to fold a thousand origami cranes (千羽鶴, senbazuru). I made about 750 in 2018, ~100 in 2019, and the last ~150 in the past few weeks. It's not just thanks to the cranes, but I feel like I have now processed most of what I needed to process when I started them. And they make for a pretty cool piece too.
