.. title: About this site
.. slug: about-this-site

This site is `ad-free <http://www.adfreeblog.org>`__, entirely
self-supported, and can be accessed free of charge.

It is currently
based on the `WordPress <http://wordpress.org/>`__ platform and uses the
custom-built `Fumseck
theme <//guillaumepaumier.com/project/fumseck/>`__. I have `evil
plans <https://github.com/gpaumier/gp2>`__ to move away from this
platform by Fall 2015.

Some of the content is available in English, some
in French and some in both; you can set your language (and check if a
given page has translations) through the Settings menu at the top.

Constructive
comments are welcome, whether I agree with them or not. Trolling, spam,
