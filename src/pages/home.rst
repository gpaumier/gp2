**I'm a Wikipedian.** I am passionate about free knowledge and I started contributing to Wikipedia in 2005. I have been serving the Wikimedia community in almost every possible role, from writing articles to giving presentations, helping small wikis deal with vandalism, creating documents, and organizing events. Since 2009, I have been working for the Wikimedia Foundation.

When I'm not working or volunteering, I enjoy spending my personal time at home and outside: baking bread, cooking French meals, hiking in the woods, taking online courses, and reading books to learn new things.
