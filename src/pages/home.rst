    Hi there.

    I'm Guillaume, and I use my superpowers for good.

    (pronounced "gui-yom" (:abbr:`IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)`: [ɡijom])

I'm a science Ph.D, a photographer and a master of organization & optimization. For fun, I travel, I put things into boxes and I play Lego.


In my work, I guide executives and mission-driven organizations through intricate, interdisciplinary challenges using integrative thinking, ingenuity, and empathy.

I like to tackle complex problems, like leading a global movement of 70,000+ volunteers through a collaborative strategy process, culminating with a hundred independent organizations worldwide agreeing on a common strategic direction.\ [1]_ Or developing bioanalysis microfluidic devices based on thermosensitive polymers.\ [2]_ Or designing software that powers the World's largest photography competition.

I currently work at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that brings free knowledge to hundreds of millions of people every month and supports them as they collectively make sense of our world.

How I think/work
================

Integrating information

I have the ability to absorb massive amounts of information on almost any topic, and extract their essence to produce a.
I take streams of information and reweave them in ways that integrate

* ability to learn quickly
* research
* Deconstruct, arrange in new ways, sensemaking, build up and construct something new, novel
* weaving in new ways
* ability to
* Integrative thinking and pattern recognition are my talents.
* That is how I connect the dots and find the signals emerging from the noise.
* document
* sometimes contradictory
* find commonalities

Understanding the human element

* emotions, cognitive biases, power dynamics, structural inequality
* variety of subjective human experiences
* My journey of self-discovery has led me to realize the importance of the human element in
* We are faillible. importance of acknowledging failures and learning from them



clarity and complexity

I have a talent for bringing clarity to complex problems.



* discernment
* bringing clarity
* Complex problems
* Systems and details
* A time view that spans past, present, and future.
* systems thinking, expertise, rigor, intellectual integrity,
* looking for the Black Swan
* cracking complexity
* system levers
* the moment of insight
* strategy, foresight
* use my ability to recognize patterns and connect the dots to find the signals that emerge from the noise.
* As a scientist, my process is to start from diligent discovery, seek out multiple perspectives, and convert research into insights. I love to understand how systems work, experiment, document, and distill knowledge from observational evidence.


Bridging people and disciplines

I am able to quickly learn new concepts and become fluent in new disciplines, which makes me a great interface between people working on interdisciplinary projects.

* interdisciplinarity, working across fields with people from different backgrounds
* I am an interface between people and fields and ideas
* I like to connect ideas across fields and bridge people across teams
* integrate perspectives and knowledge across disciplines
* bridging ideas and connecting people
* is what motivates me the most, as it gives me the opportunity to constantly learn, challenge my world view, and build relationships with people from different backgrounds,
* building community by bringing differences together and finding common ground. It takes more work, but it's more sustainable and rewarding in the long term than excluding others based on arbitrary characteristics to reinforce the sense of in-group.


Use those skills towards:

* transformative social change
* fairness, justice, pluralism, pluralistic society
* positive impact
* mission-driven organizations
* particularly in the context of the climate crisis

Individual decision-making can be impeded by bounded rationality and selective exposure. An additional concern when discussing specialized topics as a large group is the information deficit of its members and the communal reinforcement built in the group over time. In order to mitigate those limitations, I strive to frame the issues I work on by situating the problem in its broader landscape, as a way to increase the quality of information available for decision-making.

It takes a village.

Barn raising is a fundamental concept in online communities like ours. Barn raising "occurs when a community actively decides to come to the same place at the same time to help achieve some specific goal."\ [#BarnRaisingMeatBall]_ The metaphor comes from the collective effort needed to raise an actual barn,\ [#BarnRaisingWP]_ a process that is all but impossible to do on one's own, and demands collaboration and good will from the community. While mostly reminiscent of 18th- and 19th-century rural North America, barn raising is only one example of communal work encountered in many societies around the world.\ [#CommunalWork]_ The Indonesian ethos of *Gotong royong* similarly refers to carrying burdens together, which sometimes translates to literally carrying your neighbor's home to a new location.\ [#GotongRoyong]_

Wikis are built by people coming together to achieve something that one person couldn't do alone. Most human endeavors are no different. A good strategy with broad alignment can't be built by just the CEO or a few executives. It takes a collective effort to carry this burden together and build it in the wiki spirit of good-faith collaboration. Only then can we raise the barn as a community.

.. [#BarnRaisingMeatBall] See `BarnRaising <http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/BarnRaising>`_ on MeatballWiki, the community reference on online communities. Barnraising is also where `Barnstars <http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/BarnStar>`_ come from, as tokens of appreciation for individual efforts.

We welcome and cherish our differences.

The sum of all knowledge for every single human being; we can’t do that by leaving people out. Our vision is about more than providing universal access to all forms of knowledge. It’s about creating an inclusive culture. It’s about inviting others to join in and thrive with us. It’s about embracing human diversity. It’s about saying, “We see you and you belong with us.”

Our differences are precious; they make us smarter, stronger, more humble. They balance our biases and weaknesses. They open our minds. We do our best work when we understand a problem from all its perspectives.

We encourage others to do what we can’t, and we help them succeed. When voices are absent, ignored, or silenced, we seek them out. We are welcoming hosts, caring neighbors, and equitable allies. We don’t fear difference. We welcome it with curiosity, delight, and hope.

Playfulness & Creativity
========================

When there isn't a global pandemic going on, I spend a fair amount of time out and about. In the past few years, I have taken up powerlifting, breadmaking, and ballet, and experimented with piano and ballroom dancing. I also like to go on long walks with or without my camera.

I am an avid reader and bibliophile, sometimes to the point of tsundoku. During the 2020 pandemic confinement, I have also spent my free time creating terrariums and bottle gardens, building construction sets, coloring mandalas, exploring new languages, and finishing to fold one thousand origami cranes.

A life of learning
==================

or adaptation

I was born in Normandy, a region of northwestern France mostly known for its cheese, apples, and rain. I grew up in a middle-class family of telecom workers and was a remarkably unremarkable child. I read a lot, didn't like sports, and spent most of my time alone. Reading a lot and not liking sports didn't help with the alone thing either.

   :figwidth: 10em

When I was fourteen, my family moved to Réunion, a wonderful French island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and not far from Mauritius. Réunion is mostly known for its sugar cane, active volcano, and (contrary to Normandy) beautiful tropical weather. Except during cyclone season. During cyclone season, it's (like Normandy) a lot of rain.

We moved in the middle of the school year.\ [#troisieme]_ While the curriculum was mostly standardized at the national level, it wasn't necessarily covered in the same order or with the same textbooks, but I adapted. Apart from that: many books, little exercise, much solitude. The usual, except with sun and palm trees.

.. [#troisieme] We moved when I was halfway through my *troisième*, i.e. what would be the 8th grade in the US.

After high school, I went on to college at *Université de la Réunion* to study math, computer science, and some physics & chemistry on the side. After my first year, we moved back to Normandy, which meant doing the transfer dance all over again.

The university curriculum was less standardized, and I had a lot to catch up on, but I didn't mind. On the contrary, I felt like it was an opportunity for me to learn about new things.

.. pull-quote::

   I started to realize that I needed to be intellectually stimulated, and that I had the capacity to adapt and catch up quickly.

A year later, I enrolled at a *Grande École* to study engineering physics, microelectronics, and nanotechnology. One reason was that I loved how physics helped me understand the world. Another reason was that the idea of getting a Doctorate in Physics sounded cool. Another reason was that I had read a science-fiction book a few years earlier,[#faust]_ in which nanotechnology was used to improve physical performance, and 19-year-old-Guillaume-with-body-image-issues was finding that concept fascinating. Another reason was that the college was in Toulouse, a lovely city in southwestern France with much less rain than Normandy.

Not all of those reasons were good reasons. Youth is naïve. It all turned out alright.
