    Hi there.

    I'm Guillaume, and I use my superpowers for good.

In my work, I guide executives and mission-driven organizations through intricate, interdisciplinary challenges using integrative thinking, ingenuity, and empathy.

I like to tackle complex problems, like leading a global movement of 70,000+ volunteers through a collaborative strategy process, culminating with nearly a hundred independent organizations worldwide agreeing on a common strategic direction.\ [1]_ Or developing bioanalysis microfluidic devices based on thermosensitive polymers.\ [2]_ Or designing software that powers the World's largest photography competition.\ [3]_

I currently work at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that brings free knowledge to hundreds of millions of people every month and supports them as they collectively make sense of our world.

How I think
===========

Looking back:

* adaptation
* ability to learn quickly
* interdisciplinarity, working across fields with people from different backgrounds
* building stuff
* defining/scoping and solving problems
* bringing clarity
* research

My journey of self-discovery has led me to realize the importance of the human element in

multiple perspectives to `get more hands onto that elephant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant>`_.

variety of subjective human experiences

I like to connect ideas across fields and bridge people across teams


transformative social change.

systems thinking, expertise, rigor, intellectual integrity,


Integrative thinking and pattern recognition are my talents. That is how I connect the dots and find the signals emerging from the noise.



, bridging ideas and connecting people

positive impact

As a scientist, my process is to start from diligent discovery, seek out multiple perspectives, and convert research into  insights. I love to understand how systems work, experiment, document, and distill knowledge from observational evidence.

, and use my ability to recognize patterns and connect the dots to find the signals that emerge from the noise.
interdisciplinary work


is what motivates me the most, as it gives me the opportunity to constantly learn, challenge my world view, and build relationships with people from different backgrounds,

Welcome to my humble corner of the Internet. Here I document
cracking complexity
system levers
seek insights from observational evidence
learning from failure
the moment of insight
looking for the Black Swan
strategy
obsessive documenter
disciplined problem solving
emergent strategy


I'm an interdisciplinary scientist.
I'm an engineer.
I'm a writer.
I'm a photographer.
I'm a Wikipedian.

A life of learning
==================

or adaptation

   :figwidth: 10em

I was born in Normandy, a region of northwestern France mostly known for its cheese, apples, and rain. I grew up in a middle-class family of telecom workers and was a remarkably unremarkable child. I read a lot, didn't like sports, and spent most of my time alone. Reading a lot and not liking sports didn't help with the alone thing either.

When I was fourteen, my family moved to Réunion, a wonderful French island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and not far from Mauritius. Réunion is mostly known for its sugar cane, active volcano, and (contrary to Normandy) beautiful tropical weather. Except during cyclone season. During cyclone season, it's (like Normandy) a lot of rain.

We moved in the middle of the school year.\ [#troisieme]_ While the curriculum was mostly standardized at the national level, it wasn't necessarily covered in the same order or with the same textbooks, but I adapted. Apart from that: many books, little exercise, much solitude. The usual, except with sun and palmtrees.

.. [#troisieme] We moved when I was halfway through my *troisième*, i.e. what would be the 8th grade in the US.

After high school, I went on to college at *Université de la Réunion* to study math, computer science, and some physics & chemistry on the side. After my first year, we moved back to Normandy, which meant doing the transfer dance all over again.

The university curriculum was less standardized, and I had a lot to catch up on, but I didn't mind. On the contrary, I felt like it was an opportunity for me to learn about new things.

.. pull-quote::

   I started to realize that I needed to be intellectually stimulated, and that I had the capacity to adapt and catch up quickly.

A year later, I joined a college-like |grande-ecole|_ to study engineering physics, microelectronics, and nanotechnology. One reason was that I loved how physics helped me understand the world. Another reason was that the idea of getting a Doctorate in Physics sounded cool. Another reason was that I had read a science-fiction book a few years earlier\ [#faust]_ in which nanotechnology was used to improve physical performance, and 19-year-old-Guillaume-with-body-image-issues found that concept fascinating. Another reason was that the college was in Toulouse, a lovely city in southwestern France with much less rain than Normandy.

Not all of those reasons were good reasons. Youth is naïve. It all turned out alright.
