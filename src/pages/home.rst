   Hi there.

   I'm Guillaume,\ [#pronunciation]_ and I use my superpowers for good. I'm an expert at untangling things and reweaving them in ways that make sense.

   .. [#pronunciation] pronounced "gui-yom" (:abbr:`IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)`: [É¡ijom].

   In my work, I guide executives and mission-driven organizations through intricate, interdisciplinary challenges using integrative thinking, curiosity, and empathy.

   In recent years, I have developed a specialty of serving as a trusted agent, confidant, and thought partner for executives. I have focused on strategic planning, revenue strategy, and generally bringing clarity to complex socio-technical problems.

   .. class:: rowspan-3

   I like to tackle complex problems, like leading a global movement of 70,000+ volunteers through a collaborative strategy process, culminating with a hundred independent organizations worldwide agreeing on a common strategic direction.\ [#Wikimedia2030]_ Or developing bioanalysis microfluidic devices based on thermosensitive polymers.\ [#PNIPAM]_ Or designing software that powers the World's largest photography competition.

   I currently work at the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit organization that brings free knowledge to hundreds of millions of people every month, and supports them as they collectively make sense of our world.

How I think

Integrating information
-----------------------

I have the ability to absorb massive amounts of information on almost any topic, and quickly understand new paradigms.\ [#Pretender]_ Although a physics engineer by training, I have held many different roles over the years, earning from my colleagues nicknames such as the "staff economist," "staff philosopher," and "the soul of the organization."

.. [#Pretender] Not unlike Jarod in the 1996 NBC series |The Pretender|_, except not quite as extraordinary, and sans the abduction-escape-and-chase by a nefarious Delaware-based organization.

.. |The Pretender| replace:: *The Pretender*

.. _The Pretender: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pretender_(TV_series)>

I communicate from a place of curiosity: I ask lots of questions to learn more about a problem, deconstruct it, and identify underlying assumptions. I dig into the "why" a lot. When two opposite choices are unsatisfactory, I seek to find a third one.\ [#CreatingGreatChoices]_ I am rarely attached to specific answers, and prefer instead to find solutions with others using the Socratic method.

.. [#CreatingGreatChoices] This process comes naturally to me, but Roger Martin and Jennifer Riel refer to it as "integrative thinking" in their 2017 book, *Creating Great Choices: A Leader's Guide to Integrative Thinking* (Harvard Business Review Press. ISBN 978-1633692961). Their work builds on Martin's earlier book, *The Opposable Mind*, which focused on leaders who "can hold two opposing ideas in their minds at once, and then reach a synthesis that actually improves on each." (Harvard Business Review Press, 2007. ISBN 978-1422118924).

Understanding the human element
-------------------------------

Very few problems are purely technical; solving a problem often means understanding the human emotions in the room, as well as cognitive biases, power dynamics, historical context, privilege, and structural inequality. My own journey of self-discovery has taught the importance of the human element, and the need to consider the variety of subjective human experiences. In particular, when solving problems, I believe it is essential to accept our fallibility, acknowledge failures, and learn from them.

Seeing systems
--------------

I have a talent for bringing clarity to complex problems. I move easily between the system view and the details, between the past that has shaped where we are today and the future we may still shape. I particularly enjoy imagining different futures as a way to manage the unexpected and make difficult choices.

As a scientist, my process is to start from diligent discovery, seek out multiple perspectives, and convert research into insights. I love to understand how systems work, experiment, document, and distill knowledge from observational evidence.

systems thinking, recognize patterns, comfortable with ambiguity

Connecting people and ideas
---------------------------

My interdisciplinary research taught me to connect ideas across disciplines, a skill I have used to help people from different backgrounds understand each other and build trust.

In college, I started studying math and computer science before pivoting to engineering physics and nanotechnology. Then, I sought out interdisciplinary work at the crossroads of microelectronics, chemistry, and biology. Later, I joined Wikipedia and applied my skills to software product management, communications, strategy, and revenue.

I am able to quickly learn new concepts and become fluent in new disciplines, which makes me a great interface between people working on interdisciplinary projects.

pattern recognition

is what motivates me the most, as it gives me the opportunity to constantly learn, challenge my world view, and build relationships with people from different backgrounds,

building community by bringing differences together and finding common ground. It takes more work, but it's more sustainable and rewarding in the long term than excluding others based on arbitrary characteristics to reinforce the sense of in-group.

My favorite problems are those without an obvious solution, because I get to learn new things


Seeing different perspectives
-----------------------------

defer judgment until we understand the different perspectives. // Individual decision-making can be impeded by bounded rationality and selective exposure. An additional concern when discussing specialized topics as a large group is the information deficit of its members and the communal reinforcement built in the group over time. In order to mitigate those limitations, I strive to frame the issues I work on by situating the problem in its broader landscape, as a way to increase the quality of information available for decision-making.

Working as a community
----------------------

.. class:: rowspan-4

It takes a village. // Barn raising is a fundamental concept in the study of online communities. Barn raising "occurs when a community actively decides to come to the same place at the same time to help achieve some specific goal."\ [#BarnRaisingMeatBall]_ The metaphor comes from the collective effort needed to raise an actual barn,\ [#BarnRaisingWP]_ a process that is all but impossible to do on one's own, and demands collaboration and good will from the community. While mostly reminiscent of 18th- and 19th-century rural North America, barn raising is only one example of communal work encountered in many societies around the world.\ [#CommunalWork]_ The Indonesian ethos of *Gotong royong* similarly refers to carrying burdens together, which sometimes translates to literally carrying your neighbor's home to a new location.\ [#GotongRoyong]_

.. [#BarnRaisingMeatBall] See `BarnRaising <http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/BarnRaising>`_ on MeatballWiki, the community reference on online communities. Barnraising is also where `Barnstars <http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/BarnStar>`_ come from, as tokens of appreciation for individual efforts.

.. [#BarnRaisingWP] See `Barn raising <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_raising>`_ on the English-language Wikipedia.

.. [#CommunalWork] See `Communal work <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communal_work>`_ on the English-language Wikipedia.

.. [#GotongRoyong] See `Gotong royong <https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotong_royong>`_ on the Indonesian-language Wikipedia.

Wikis are built by people coming together to achieve something that one person couldn't do alone. Most human endeavors are no different. A good strategy with broad alignment can't be built by just the CEO or a few executives. It takes a collective effort to carry this burden together and build it in the wiki spirit of good-faith collaboration. Only then can we raise the barn as a community.


Justice and belonging
---------------------


I feel compelled to use my skills for the common good, and I have a particular affinity for mission-driven organizations that seek  transformative social change. I find John Rawls's "veil of ignorance" approach to be a useful basis for a theory of justice, particularly in the context of the climate crisis. I believe in building a fair, just, pluralistic society, and in dismantling systems of oppression.

.. sidebar::

   The "`veil of ignorance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position>`__" approach (also called "original position") formulated by Rawls invites us to make decisions about the basic structure of society from "behind the veil," meaning as if you had no knowledge of the ethnicity, social status, gender, or other characteristics you will find yourself with in that society.

I am passionate about free knowledge and I started contributing to Wikipedia in 2005. I have been serving the Wikimedia community in almost every possible role, from writing articles to giving presentations, helping small wikis deal with vandalism, creating documents, and organizing events. Since 2009, I have been working for the Wikimedia Foundation.

We welcome and cherish our differences.

The sum of all knowledge for every single human being; we canât do that by leaving people out. Our vision is about more than providing universal access to all forms of knowledge. Itâs about creating an inclusive culture. Itâs about inviting others to join in and thrive with us. Itâs about embracing human diversity. Itâs about saying, âWe see you and you belong with us.â

Our differences are precious; they make us smarter, stronger, more humble. They balance our biases and weaknesses. They open our minds. We do our best work when we understand a problem from all its perspectives.

We encourage others to do what we canât, and we help them succeed. When voices are absent, ignored, or silenced, we seek them out. We are welcoming hosts, caring neighbors, and equitable allies. We donât fear difference. We welcome it with curiosity, delight, and hope.

Playfulness & Creativity
========================

.. figure:: /images/plants_3808.jpg

When there isn't a global pandemic going on, I spend a fair amount of time out and about. In the past few years, I have taken up powerlifting, breadmaking, and ballet, and experimented with piano and ballroom dancing. I also like to go on long walks with or without my camera.

I am an avid reader and bibliophile, sometimes to the point of tsundoku. During the 2020 pandemic confinement, I have also spent my free time creating terrariums and bottle gardens, building construction sets, coloring mandalas, exploring new languages, and finishing to fold one thousand origami cranes.

or adaptation

I was born in Normandy, a region of northwestern France mostly known for its cheese, apples, and rain. I grew up in a middle-class family of telecom workers and was a remarkably unremarkable child. I read a lot, didn't like sports, and spent most of my time alone. Reading a lot and not liking sports didn't help with the alone thing either.

.. figure:: /images/debout_sur_la_bouee.jpg
   :figwidth: 10em

When I was fourteen, my family moved to RÃ©union, a wonderful French island in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and not far from Mauritius. RÃ©union is mostly known for its sugar cane, active volcano, and (contrary to Normandy) beautiful tropical weather. Except during cyclone season. During cyclone season, it's (like Normandy) a lot of rain.

We moved in the middle of the school year.\ [#troisieme]_ While the curriculum was mostly standardized at the national level, it wasn't necessarily covered in the same order or with the same textbooks, but I adapted. Apart from that: many books, little exercise, much solitude. The usual, except with sun and palm trees.

.. [#troisieme] We moved when I was halfway through my *troisiÃ¨me*, i.e. what would be the 8th grade in the US.

After high school, I went on to college at *UniversitÃ© de la RÃ©union* to study math, computer science, and some physics & chemistry on the side. After my first year, we moved back to Normandy, which meant doing the transfer dance all over again.

The university curriculum was less standardized, and I had a lot to catch up on, but I didn't mind. On the contrary, I felt like it was an opportunity for me to learn about new things.

.. pull-quote::

   I started to realize that I needed to be intellectually stimulated, and that I had the capacity to adapt and catch up quickly.

A year later, I enrolled at a *Grande Ãcole* to study engineering physics, microelectronics, and nanotechnology. One reason was that I loved how physics helped me understand the world. Another reason was that the idea of getting a Doctorate in Physics sounded cool. Another reason was that I had read a science-fiction book a few years earlier,\ [#faust]_ in which nanotechnology was used to improve physical performance, and 19-year-old-Guillaume-with-body-image-issues was finding that concept fascinating. Another reason was that the college was in Toulouse, a lovely city in southwestern France with much less rain than Normandy.

Not all of those reasons were good reasons. Youth is naÃ¯ve. It all turned out alright.
