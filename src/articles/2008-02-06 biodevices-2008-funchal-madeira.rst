|Preview of the poster| Click to download the high-resolution PDF file (4.7 MB) "`Biodevices <http://www.biodevices.org/Biodevices2008/index.htm>`__\ " is short for "International conference on biomedical electronics and devices". It's a relatively young conference, but wide-encompassing, which made it quite interesting. For this poster, I reused the `design I made with Scribus for MicroTAS 2007 <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2007/10/14/microtas-2007-paris-france/>`__ and I came up with a nice poster that I am now sharing here. Some PDF viewers may have some trouble displaying this file, because it uses transparency and layers. I recommend using the latest version of `Adobe Reader <http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/>`__.
