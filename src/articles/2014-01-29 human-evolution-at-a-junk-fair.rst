    An old biology book, a terrestrial globe and a human skull wearing glasses: this is the sort of weird arrangements you may encounter on a French open-air junk and antiques fair.


I love junk and antique fairs. I never buy anything, but I love walking around and taking pictures of old objects and antiques. They're sometimes juxtaposed in a fun or absurd way, as is the case here. I also like the composition of this picture and the complementarity of the colors.

The book is the first volume of |evolution|_ *étude biologique, psychologique et sociologique de l'homme*, a four-volume collection on biology, psychology and sociology published 60 years ago. As for the literate skull, I decided to call him `Charles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin>`__, in a striking feat of unoriginality.

This particular junk and antiques fair took place at `Place des Quinconces <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_des_Quinconces>`__, a huge square in Bordeaux, France.

    Ceci est une pipe.


I like all these old objects, because they feel like tethers to a past I wasn't a part of. Taking photos of old stuff feels like preserving it for posterity.
