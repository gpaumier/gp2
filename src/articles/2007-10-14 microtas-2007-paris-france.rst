"`MicroTAS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroTAS>`__\ " (also written "ÂµTAS") stands for "Micro Total Analysis Systems", a subset of the field of labs-on-chips that specializes in the analysis of total (unprocessed) samples, like a drop of blood. `MicroTAS <http://www.microtas2007.org/>`__ (the conference), as its name does not indicate, is the *International conference on biomedical electronics and devices*. It's one of the major conferences in the field of labs-on-chip, and we were thrilled to have a paper accepted, even if it was "just" for a poster.

Most (if not all) of my colleagues use PowerPoint to make their posters. Besides the fact that it is a proprietary and expensive software, it also remains a presentation program suited for, well, presentations. A poster is *not* a presentation, and there are more suited tools than presentation programs, such as desktop publishing programs.

I have been using an open source desktop publishing software called `Scribus, <http://www.scribus.net/>`__ for some time now and I just love it. Scribus supports layered elements, has an awesome color management system and offers a PDF export feature of outstanding quality; it even supported `PDF/X-3 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/X>`__ export before any other (proprietary) software.

The Great Wave
==============

Posters sessions are usually quite dull. The presenters often forget that researchers who attend a conference have very little time to devote to the posters. I decided to come up with an original design to attract visitors who would then learn about my research & results. My poster was about a new way to generate waves in microchannels using polymer-based mixers. I looked up in the `"Waves" category <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Waves>`__ on Wikimedia Commons, the free media repository, and I stumbled upon this old Japanese painting called *`The Great Wave off Kanagawa <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa>`__*. I found a high-resolution, high-quality copy that I used as background image for my `A0 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:A_size_illustration.svg>`__ poster.

Needless to say, my poster got much more attention than its neighbors. Researchers from Asia were particularly excited about it, and they represented a large part of the audience. *You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar*, says the English idiom. It is also true for scientific communication: you can catch more attention from researchers with original, attractive documents than with boring, poorly-designed ones.

The high-resolution PDF version of the poster is now available for download. Some PDF viewers may have some trouble displaying this file, because it uses transparency and layers. I recommend using the latest version of `Adobe Reader <http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/>`__.
