.. highlights::

    The lab where I currently work recently inaugurated two new buildings dedicated to technological research. As the official photographer for the event, I took this opportunity to take a few pictures of the facility itself to illustrate related Wikipedia articles.

I currently work at the `Laboratory for analysis and architecture of systems <http://www.laas.fr>`__ (*Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architectures des systèmes*, LAAS) in Toulouse, France. It has recently been extended with two new buildings, one of which is hosting the brand new technological facility. It is mainly composed of a 1500-m² `cleanroom <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanroom>`__ used to assemble `micro- and nanosystems <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/07/07/interdisciplinarity-biology-micro-nanotechnologies/>`__ in a dust-free environment.

Besides the speeches by various political representatives and high-ranking researchers, the inauguration was also a great opportunity to document the facility and its equipment. Even though I didn't have a lot of freedom (or time), these pictures can be particularly useful to illustrate relevant articles in Wikipedia, such as |thermal oxydation|_ and |PECVD|_ (PECVD).

.. |thermal oxydation| replace:: *Thermal oxydation*
.. _thermal oxydation: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thermal_oxidation&oldid=271547745

.. |PECVD| replace:: *Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition*
.. _PECVD: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Plasma-enhanced_chemical_vapor_deposition&oldid=268805303

And once a media file is on Wikimedia Commons, it can be used across all Wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia `in Russian <http://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5&oldid=12010807>`__ or `in Japanese <http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%BA%E3%83%9ECVD&oldid=23332504>`__.
