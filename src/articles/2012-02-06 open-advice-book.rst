    The Open Advice book, a collection of essays, stories and lessons learned by members of the Free Software community, is out. It notably contains a chapter I wrote on software usability.

      The "Open Advice" book is available for free download, or purchase as print from lulu.com.

`The book <http://open-advice.org>`__ was just `announced at FOSDEM <http://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/openadvice>`__, the `Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting <http://fosdem.org/2012/>`__, in Brussels over the week-end.

About 50 authors from many different projects of the free software community were brought together by `Lydia Pintscher <http://blog.lydiapintscher.de>`__, the book's editor, who started the project in early 2011.

A year and 380 pages later, the book is now available, and tries to provide an answer to the question: *What's the key thing you would have liked to know when you started contributing?*

Authors answer that question for many topics, ranging from "Writing patches" to "Documentation for Novices," to business models, conferences, translation, design, and more.

I contributed "Learn from your users," a chapter on user experience and usability testing. You'll also recognize other names from the Wikimedia community, like Evan Prodromou, Markus Kr√∂tzsch and Felipe Ortega. You can learn more about the book and the authors on the `book's website <http://open-advice.org>`__.

You can `download the book <http://open-advice.org/#dwnbox>`__ for free as a PDF file, `order a print <http://open-advice.org/#buybox>`__ from lulu.com if you prefer paper books, or `fork the text <https://github.com/lydiapintscher/Open-Advice>`__ on GitHub. I hope you'll like the book, and it'll prove useful, whether you're new to the world of software, or you're a seasoned contributor already.
