The convergence between technological and natural objects at the micro- and nanoscale has been long emphasized, and is usually summarized with this famous quote:

    *Because technology provides the tools and biology the problems, the two should enjoy a happy marriage.*

    â€” Stanley Fields[1. Stanley Fields, *The interplay of biology and technology*, PNAS, August 28, 2001, 98 (18), 10051-10054; doi: `10.1073/pnas.191380098 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.191380098>`__; `full text <http://www.pnas.org/content/98/18/10051.full>`__]

Although this statement is awfully simplistic, biology and technology do enjoy a happy marriage, and I was thrilled to experience it during the last three years. My Ph.D work has been very interdisciplinary and I wanted to dedicate a special section of my thesis to how cool, yet difficult, it is to work at the crossroads of biology, chemistry, physics & technology. Because an image is worth a thousand words, I assembled a nice comparison of various reference biological objects and technological devices at the micro- and nanoscale. Most of the images I used were available on Wikimedia Commons and I made the others. The source file is vector graphics, i.e. it can be resized at will without loss of quality or pixelation.
