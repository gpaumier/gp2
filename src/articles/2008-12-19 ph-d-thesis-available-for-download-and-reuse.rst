.. excerpt: I am glad to announce that my Ph.D thesis on "PNIPAM technologies for lab on chips" is now available for download.

|Preview of the thesis| Click to download the high-quality PDF thesis (PDF, 130 p., 6.45 MB) The document is only available in French (per University policy), but there are some pretty pictures and infographics in there too for people who don't speak French; one of them is the `"Interdisciplinarity, biology and micro-nanotechnologies" <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/07/07/interdisciplinarity-biology-micro-nanotechnologies/>`__ information graphics I published earlier.

Summary
=======

    Labs on chips are miniaturized devices integrating one or several laboratory functions, usually dedicated to the handling of chemical and biological samples. Our work aimed at integrating a smart polymer called poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) in microsystems, in order to develop a new technological process for labs on chips. PNIPAM is a thermosensitive polymer that undergoes a reversible state transition; it switches from a hydrophilic, swollen state below its temperature of transition (LCST ~ 32Â°C), to a hydrophobic, collapsed state above it. The technology we developed is based on heating elements and a surface functionalization process to graft the PNIPAM layer. Our results show that the electro-osmotic flow can be modulated by thermally controlling the PNIPAM, thus paving the way to electrokinetic mixers. This thermal control also enables the adsorption (and partial desorption) of proteins on fonctionalized beads, the main application being sample preparation. Keywords: Lab on a chip, NIPAM, microfluidics, thermosensitive polymer.

Tools
=====

I mainly used LaTeX to create this document. All vector infographics were made using Inkscape. Although the PDF file can be searched as plain text, I have also started to convert the document to wikitext in order to make the whole content `available on Wikisource <http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Technologies_PNIPAM_pour_les_laboratoires_sur_puce>`__. However, this process takes time and I have other priorities at the moment, so any help is welcome in the meantime.
