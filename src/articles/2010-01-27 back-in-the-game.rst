The last couple of weeks have been quite busy for me. I moved from Toulouse, France, to San Francisco, California as a consequence of my hiring by the `Wikimedia Foundation <http://wikimediafoundation.org>`__ (the non-profit that runs Wikipedia) where I work as Product Manager for `Multimedia Usability <http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Multimedia:About>`__. I just got my Internet connection at home set up, so you should see more regular blog articles now. I have a few drafts in the works and a lot of updates to post related to my work at the Foundation. In the meantime, I invite you to read the `summary published today on the Wikimedia blog <http://blog.wikimedia.org/2010/01/26/multimedia-usability-project-underway/>`__.
