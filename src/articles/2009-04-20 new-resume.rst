    My former resume was a clean scientific resume in its form and layout. I had made it using :math:`\LaTeX` and it helped me find my two latest positions as a researcher. However, as a classic resume, it was as boring as the documents I usually disparage, so I decided to listen to my own advice, and have the look support the content.

The resume's content was pretty stable and up-to-date, so I knew I wouldn't have to change that much. I decided to focus on its appearance, hence why I chose to make the new resume with Scribus, my favorite desktop publishing software.

A dual-skill profile
====================

I have a peculiar profile. On the one hand, I have had a high-level scientific training in engineering, physics & micro-electronics. I graduated from a top French |grande école|_ and I got a master's degree in nanotechnologies and nanosciences. I completed my Ph.D in the field of microsystems for life sciences and lab-on-chips. All my positions have been `at the crossroads of technology, biology and chemistry <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/07/07/interdisciplinarity-biology-micro-nanotechnologies/>`__.

On the other hand, I have been working as a communications & marketing volunteer for the `Wikimedia Foundation <http://wikimediafoundation.org>`__ for about two and a half years now. I have answered the press, supported the Foundation's Head of communications and created institutional documents. I have also co-managed the customer service of the Foundation, recruited new volunteers and recently started a PR material cleanup as the first step before a complete revamp of our PR / marketing material.

A consistent layout and look
============================

I wanted my resume to really show these two sides of my profile. After much thought and many attempts, I came up with a nice two-column design that uses my favorite color scheme (the same as for the `new logo of unfoldscience <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2009/04/10/new-logo-for-unfoldscience/>`__). Each column is dedicated to one side of my experiences and training and leads naturally to the job opportunities I am looking for now.
