    Hidden in a clearing in the middle of the forest, this dwelling looks like a miniature version of traditional Normandy houses.


I was taking a walk with my family in the forest of Lyons, in Normandy, and we found this abandoned dwelling in a small clearing. It has half-timbered walls whose infill appears to be crumbling; such walls are typical of the Normandy architecture. This large forest is known for its straight, tall Beech trees. It gave its name to `Lyons-la-Forêt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyons-la-For%C3%AAt>`__, a nearby village, not too far from where I grew up.

Because the forest is so big, it's also very quiet; most man-made sounds are muffled or silenced, leaving only the sounds of birds, trees and small water streams.

    The forest is also home to water streams and the Fountain of Saint-Catherine.
