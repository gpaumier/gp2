A lot of people have shown interest in the `Multimedia usability project <http://usability.wikimedia.org/wiki/Multimedia:About>`__ and it turns out that many questions are similar. I would like to answer as many questions as possible, but on the other hand I also have to optimize the time devoted to such activities. A good venue for this kind of Q/A is the Wikimedia "IRC office hours", a weekly event during which a Wikimedia staff member answers questions on `IRC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`__. As a consequence, I will be available on IRC to answer questions related to the Multimedia usability project this Thursday, February 4, 2010 @ 1700 UTC. You can use the `fixed time world clock <http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=2&day=4&year=2009&hour=9&min=0&sec=0&p1=224>`__ to check the time in your timezone. Please join us in `#wikimedia-office on Freenode <irc://irc.freenode.net/wikimedia-office>`__ using your favorite IRC client; you may also use web-based clients (check out the `IRC office hours page <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC_office_hours>`__ on meta-wiki for more information on how to do that). Looking forward to your questions.
