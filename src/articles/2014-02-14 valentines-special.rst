These are some of my most reused photos in printed publications and across the web. I find them very powerful in their simplicity. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, but when I look at those, I can't help but imagine that the stories they're telling are much longer than that. Happy Valentine's Day. |Gay pride 2011 à Toulouse| |Gay pride 2011 à Toulouse|
