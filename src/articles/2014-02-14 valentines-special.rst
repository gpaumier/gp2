.. highlights::

    No red hearts, archer angels or cheesy cards. Just a couple of photos (of couples).


These are some of my most reused photos in printed publications and across the web. I find them very powerful in their simplicity.

As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, but when I look at those, I can't help but imagine that the stories they're telling are much longer than that.

Happy Valentine's Day.
