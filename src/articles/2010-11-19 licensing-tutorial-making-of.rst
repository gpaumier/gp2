A few days ago, I announced the publication of the English version of an `illustrated licensing tutorial for Wikimedia Commons <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2010/11/05/illustrated-licensing-tutorial-for-wikimedia-commons/>`__. The tutorial was developed as part of the Multimedia usability project I've been working on for the past year. This article invites you on a behind-the-scenes tour of the licensing tutorial project.

Context
=======

Because all Wikimedia projects are based on `free licenses <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre_knowledge>`__, Wikimedians have developed a particular expertise in this field, and in copyright in general. One of my favorite quotes about Wikimedians is from `Sue Gardner's keynote session <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:200908281553-Sue_Gardner-The_Wikimedia_Foundation_The_Year_In_Review_and_The_Year_Ahead.ogg>`__ at Wikimania 2009 in Buenos Aires:

    You all know more about copyright law than any sane, sensible human being. **

We do. And it's hard to remember how little we knew about copyright a few years ago, when we had just started to edit. Back then, most of us had never heard about the GFDL, or about Creative Commons. Back then, we had never heard of `*Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.* <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.>`__ or the `*Place des Terreaux* case <http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Cour_de_cassation_-_03-14.820>`__\ [1. If you know the first one, you earn 50 `Wikipediholism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipediholic>`__ points. If you know the second one, you earn 1000. Except if you're French, in which case you earn only 500.].

Copyright is an incredibly complicated topic, especially in an international context. We've grown accustomed to it, but the learning curve is very steep for new users.

|A small preview of the Arabic version of the licensing tutorial| The tutorial has been translated and localized into many languages, such as Arabic.

Once the English version was ready, the translation process started. `Casey Brown <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Cbrown1023>`__ and I `prepared the translation framework <http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_tutorial>`__ and provided detailed pieces of advice, in order to inform translators and help them with this particular translation request.

I used to be a Wikimedia translator myself, and I knew how effective they were. Still, I was amazed to discover that, after only three days, about 20 translations of the text had been completed. Furthermore, they had already integrated the translations in about a dozen localized versions of the artwork.

As it turns out, the coordination page containing advice and instructions proved to be very helpful to translators, and well worth the time I had invested in it. About `eighteen localized versions <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikimedia_Commons_licensing_tutorial>`__ are available now, and more are underway.

What next?
==========

The real test, of course, will be when new participants are presented with the tutorial. Will they like it? Will they read it, or jump directly to the next step? Will the tutorial be successful in helping them learn what we want to teach?

So far, we haven't formally tested it. We were hoping to conduct a study on the tutorial and the latest version of our `upload wizard prototype <http://commons.prototype.wikimedia.org/uwd>`__, but we had to postpone it. I do hope we'll be able to measure the impact of the tutorial at a later point. Still, the enthusiasm with which the tutorial has been welcomed is, it seems, a good sign.

I hope this summary will be helpful to people conducting similar projects. I feel the interaction with the rest of the community has been quite smooth during the whole project. It would be presumptuous to think it was only because I've been a long-time community member myself, but it sure helped to speak the same language as the users'.

More generally, the Multimedia usability project was the first engineering project of the Wikimedia Foundation with a Product Manager on its team. I feel this role has played a critical bridging role between the users and the rest of the team, to everyone's benefit. I'd love to see this happening more regularly in WMF-driven projects.

My own *lessons learned*, in a nutshell:

-  Trust the Power of The Crowd.
-  Collaboration is worth the effort.
