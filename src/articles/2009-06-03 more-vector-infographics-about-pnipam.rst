    A collection of resizable, editable information graphics I used in my Ph.D thesis to explain the various uses of poly(*N*-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) for biology and healthcare.

I published earlier some infographics I created for `my Ph.D thesis <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/12/19/ph-d-thesis-available-for-download-and-reuse/>`__, for example the `comparison between biological and technological objects <http://guillaumepaumier.com/2008/07/07/interdisciplinarity-biology-micro-nanotechnologies/>`__ at the micro and nano scale. Below are a few more specific to PNIPAM; they're now also available to illustrate Wikipedia articles about PNIPAM.

Conformational switch (pictured above)
======================================

PNIPAM is a thermosensitive polymer that undergoes a reversible coil-to-globule conformational transition around its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), around 32Â°C. It switches from a hydrophilic, swollen state to a hydrophobic, collapsed state.

PNIPAM-based immunoassay
========================

The peculiar properties of PNIPAM make it possible to use this polymer as a support for immunoassays based on thermal precipitation.

Cell culture
============

PNIPAM-grafted surfaces can be used as a soft support for cell cultures. Cells grow on hydrophobic PNIPAM and are softly released by lowering the temperature and making the PNIPAM hydrophilic.

Adsorption and release of proteins
==================================

The same way cells adsorb on hydrophobic PNIPAM surfaces, proteins may be reversibly trapped on PNIPAM surfaces, then released upon command. This is actually one of the things I did during my Ph.D.
