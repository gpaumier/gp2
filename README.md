# gp2

Another experiment in defying the Second Law of Thermodynamics

## Installing

    npm install
    bower install

## Developing

In a console:
    brunch watch

In another console:
    node build.js

Bits (JS and CSS) changes will be picked up by brunch and compiled, then metalsmith will update its build folder.
